A
statement
that
wa
refut
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
vermont
who
wa
a
support
of
her
who
said
yeah
in
campaign
peopl
tend
to
exagger
here
is
the
fact
on
gun
let
talk
about
gun
that
horribl
horribl
sandi
hook
—
what
the
word
we
want
to
use
murder
assault
slaughter
unspeak
act
back
in
1988
I
ran
for
the
unit
state
congress
one
seat
in
the
state
of
vermont
I
probabl
lost
that
elect
which
I
lost
by
three
point
becaus
I
wa
the
onli
candid
run
who
said
you
know
what?
We
should
ban
assault
weapon
not
seen
them
sold
or
distribut
in
the
unit
state
of
america
I
have
got
a
d-minu
vote
record
from
the
nra
[applause]
and
in
fact
becaus
I
come
from
a
state
which
ha
virtual
no
gun
control
I
believ
that
I
am
the
best
qualifi
candid
to
bring
back
togeth
that
consensu
that
is
desper
need
in
thi
countri
[applause]
blitzer:
thank
you
senat
thank
you
[cheering]
secretari
clinton
I
want
you
to
respond
to
that
but
whi
did
you
put
out
that
statement
blame
vermont
and
it
gun
polici
for
some
of
the
death
of
—
by
gun
in
new
york?
well
the
fact
are
that
most
of
the
gun
that
end
up
commit
crime
in
new
york
come
from
out
of
state
they
come
from
the
state
that
do
not
have
kind
of
seriou
effort
to
control
gun
that
we
do
in
new
york
but
let
me
say
thi
—
in
1988
as
we
have
heard
on
everi
debat
occas
senat
sander
did
run
for
the
congress
and
he
lost
He
came
back
in
1990
and
he
won
and
dure
that
campaign
he
made
a
commit
to
the
nra
that
he
would
be
against
wait
period
and
in
fact
in
hi
own
book
he
talk
about
hi
1990
campaign
and
here
what
he
said
He
clearli
wa
help
by
the
nra
becaus
they
ran
ad
against
hi
oppon
So
then
he
went
to
the
congress
where
he
ha
been
a
larg
veri
reliabl
support
of
the
nra
vote
—
he
kept
hi
word
to
the
nra
he
vote
against
the
bradi
bill
five
time
becaus
it
had
wait
period
in
it
thank
enough
peopl
final
vote
for
it
to
keep
gun
out
of
the
hand
of
who
should
not
have
them
[applause]
blitzer:
senat
I
want
you
to
respond
but
I
also
want
you
to
respond
to
thi
you
recent
said
you
do
not
think
crime
victim
should
be
abl
to
sue
gun
maker
for
damag
the
daughter

who

in
the
2012
mass

famili
an

Do
you?
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
do
everyth
that
we
can
to
make
certain
that
gun
do
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
peopl
who
do
not
have
them
now
I
vote
against
thi
gun
liabil
law
becaus
I
wa
concern
that
in
rural
area
all
over
thi
countri
if
a
gun
shop
owner
sell
a
weapon
legal
to
somebodi
and
that
person
then
goe
out
and
kill
somebodi
I
do
not
believ
it
is
appropri
that
that
gun
shop
owner
who
just
sold
a
legal
weapon
to
be
held
account
and
be
su
but
what
I
do
believ
is
when
gun
shop
owner
and
other
knowingli
are
sell
weapon
to
peopl
who
should
not
have
them
—
somebodi
walk
in
they
want
thousand
of
round
of
ammunit
or
they
want
a
whole
lot
of
gun
ye
that
gun
shop
owner
or
that
gun
manufactur
should
be
held

blitzer:
So
senat
do
you
owe
the
sandi
hook
famili
an
apology?
well
I
believ
that
the
law
that
senat
sander
vote
for
that
I
vote
against
give
thi
special
protect
to
gun
manufactur

said
we
have
tougher

hold
toy
gun
manufactur
and
seller
to

than
we
do

and
the
point
that
senat

about
how
he
would
not

that
wa

I
would
just
point
out
that
there
wa
a
vote
in
the
senat
as
to
whether
or
not
the
unit
state
should
support
the
effort
by
the
libyan
peopl
to
protect
themselv
against
the
threat
the
genocid
threat
come
from

and
whether
we
should
go
to
the

to
seek
secur

support
senat
sander
vote
for
that
and
that
exactli
what
we
did
I
do
not
think
that
anybodi
would
suggest
that
israel
invit
and
welcom
missil
fli
into
their
countri
that
is
not
the
issu
and
you
evad
the
answer
you
evad
the
question
the
question
is
not
doe
israel
have
a
right
to
respond
nor
doe
israel
have
a
right
to
go
after
terrorist
and
destroy
terror
that
not
the
debat
wa
their
respons
disproportionate?
I
believ
that
it
wa
you
have
not
answer
that
[cheering]
I
will
certainli
be
will
to
answer
it
I
think
I
did
answer
it
by
say
that
of
cours
there
have
to
be
precaut
taken
but
even
the
most
independ
analyst
will
say
the
way
that
hama
place
it
weapon
the
way
that
it
often
ha
it

it
is
terribl
i am
not

it
anyth
other
than
terribl
It
would

rememb
israel

all
the

they
turn
the
