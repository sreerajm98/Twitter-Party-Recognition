nomine

senat

would
you
like
me
to
read
it
back
to
you?
prosecutor
—
"I
believ
there
a
huge
conflict
of
interest
when
local
prosecutor

case
of

violenc
within
their
commun
most
recent
we
saw
thi
with
a
non-

of
the

involv
in
the
case
of

rice
how
would

presid
ensur
incid
of

violenc

investig
and
prosecut
fairly?"
secretari
clinton
thi
question
is
for
you
tonight
part
of
america
are
in
the
grip
of
a
deadli
heroin
epidem
span
race
and
class
hit
small
town
and
citi
alik
It
ha
becom
a
major
issu
in
thi
race
In
a
lot
of
place
where
you
have
been
campaign
despit
an
estim
trillion
dollar
spent
mani
say
the
war
on
drug
ha
fail
So
what
would
you
do?
and
that
time
senat
senat
sander
would
you
like
to
respond?
that
time
welcom
back
to
charleston
let
turn
to
anoth
area
where
there
ha
been
fierc
disagr
—
that
would
be
health
care
senat
sander
and
secretari
clinton
you
both
mention
it
in
your
100-day
prioriti
let
turn
to
my
colleagu
andrea
mitchel
now
to
lead
that
question
mitchell:
thank
you
lester
secretari
clinton
senat
sander
favor
what
he
call
"medicar
for
all"
now
you
said
that
what
he
is
propos
would
tear
up
obamacar
and
replac
it
secretari
clinton
is
it
fair
to
say
to
say
that
berni
sander
want
to
kill
obamacare?
well
andrea
I
am
absolut
commit
to
univers
health
care
I
have
work
on
thi
for
a
long
time
peopl
may
rememb
that
I
took
on
the
health
insur
industri
back
in
the
90
and
I
did
not
quit
until
we
got
the
children
health
insur
program
that
ensur
eight
million
kid
and
I
certainli
respect
senat
sander
intent
but
when
you
are
talk
about
health
care
the
detail
realli
matter
and
therefor
we
have
been
rais
question
about
the
nine
bill
that
he
introduc
over
20
year
as
to
how
they
would
work
and
what
would
be
the
impact
on
peopl
health
care?
He
did
not
like
that
hi
campaign
did
not
like
it
either
and
tonight
he
come
out
with
a
new
health
care
plan
and
again
we
need
to
get
into
the
detail
but
here
what
I
believ
the
democrat
parti
and
the
unit
state
work
sinc
harri
truman
to
get
the
afford
care
act
pass
We
final
have
a
path
to
univers
health
care
We
have
accomplish
so
much
alreadi
I
do
not
to
want
see
the
republican
repeal
it
and
I
do
not
to
want
see
us
start
over
again
with
a
contenti
debat
I
want
us
to
defend
and
build
on
the
afford
care
act
and
improv
it
[applause]
OK
mitchell:
senat
sanders?
but
—
senat
sander
if
I
can
[applause]
you
know
I
have
to
say
i am
not
sure
whether
we
are
talk
about
the
plan
you
just
introduc
tonight
or
we
are
talk
about
the
plan
you
introduc
nine
time
in
the
congress
but
the
fact
is
we
have
the
afford
care
act
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
accomplish
of
presid
obama
of
the
democrat
parti
and
of
our
countri
[applause]
and
we
have
alreadi
seen
19
million
american
get
insur
We
have
seen
the
end
of
pre-exist
condit
keep
peopl
from
get
insur
[applause]
We
have
seen
women
no
longer
pay
more
for
our
insur
than
men
and
we
have
seen
young
peopl
up
to
the
age
of
26
be
abl
to
stay
on
their
parent
polici
but
—
what
if
we
have
now
there
are
thing
we
can
do
to
improv
it
but
to
tear
it
up
and
start
over
again
push
our
countri
back
into
that
kind
of
a
contenti
debat
I
think
is
the
wrong
direct
It
is
—
it
is
absolut
inaccur
omalley:
I
have
to
talk
about
someth
that
actual
work
in
our
state
mitchell:
governor
—
governor
sander
yeah
mitchell:
you
have
talk
about
medicar
for
all
ye
mitchell:
and
tonight
you
have
releas
a
veri
detail
plan
just
two
not
all
that
detail
mitchell:
well
two
hour
befor
the
debat
you
did
well
mitchell:
but
let
me
ask
you
about
vermont
becaus
in
vermont
—
you
tri
in
the
state
of
vermont
and
vermont
walk
away
from
thi
kind
of
idea
of
—
of
medicar
for
all
single-pay
becaus
they
conclud
it
would
requir
major
tax
increas
well
that
—
you
might
want
to
ask
mitchell:
and
by
some
estim
it
would
doubl
the
budget
If
you
could
not
sell
it
in
vermont
senat
andrea
let
me
just
say
thi
mitchell:
how
can
you
sell
it
to
the
country?
let
me
just
say
that
you
might
want
to
ask
the
governor
of
the
state
of
vermont
whi
he
could
not
do
it
i am
not
the
governor
i am
the
senat
from
the
state
of
vermont
[laughter]
but
second
of
all
—
second
of
all[applause]
here
is
what
the
real
point
is
in
term
of
all
of
the
issu
you
have
rais
—
the
good
question
you
have
rais
you
know
what
it
all
come
down
to?
Do
you
know
whi
we
can not
do
what
everi
other
countri
—
major
countri
on
earth
is
doing?
it
becaus
we
have
a
campaign
financ
system
that
is
corrupt
we
have
super
pac
we
have
the
pharmaceut
industri
pour
hundr
of
million
of
dollar
into
campaign
contribut
and
lobbi
and
the
privat
insur
compani
as
well
what
thi
is
realli
about
is
not
the
ration
way
to
go
forward
—
it
medicar
for
all
—
it
is
whether
we
have
the
gut
to
stand
up
to
the
privat
insur
compani
and
all
of
their
money
and
the
pharmaceut
industri
that
what
thi
debat
should
be
about
[applause]
that
time
senat
sander
respons
[applause]
that
time
but
let
me
continu
with
the
senat
sander
let
me
continu
you
call
yourself
a
democrat
socialist
and
throughout
your
career
in
polit
you
have
been
critic
of
the
democrat
parti
you
have
been
say
in
a
book
you
wrote
quot
"there
wa
not
a
hell
of
a
big
differ
between
the
the
two
major
parties"
how
would
you
will
a
gener
elect
how
will
you
win
a
gener
elect
label
yourself
a
democrat
socialist?
ye
but
senat
you
can
and
that
is
right
secretari
clinton
our
next
question
is
for
you
here
anoth
quantit
problem
and
I
respect
disagre
with
my
friend
over
here
and
that
is
you
are
right
all
of
us
have
denounc
trump
attempt
to
divid
thi
country:
the
anti-latino
rhetor
the
racist
rhetor
he
anti-muslim
rhetor
but
where
I
disagre
with
you
governor
omalley
is
I
do
believ
we
have
to
deal
with
the
fundament
issu
of
a
hand
of
billionair
omalley:
I
agre
with
that
who
control
econom
and
polit
life
of
thi
countri
omalley:
I
agre
secretari
clinton
that
time
A
quick
follow
up
—
a
thirti
second
follow
up
whi
is
senat
sander
beat
you
to
2
to
1
among
younger
votes?
We
are
go
to
take
welcom
back
from
charleston
let
turn
now
to
the
economi
senat
sander
you
releas
a
tough
new
ad
last
week
in
which
without
mention
secretari
clinton
by
name
you
talk
about
two
democrat
vision
for
regul
wall
street
"one
say
it
OK
to
take
million
from
big
bank
and
tell
them
what
to
do
My
plan
break
up
the
big
bank
close
the
tax
loophol
and
make
them
pay
their
fair
share"
what
do
you
see
as
the
differ
between
what
you
would
do
about
the
bank
and
what
secretari
clinton
would
do?
secretari
clinton
help
the
voter
understand
the
daylight
between
the
two
of
you
here
well
there
no
daylight
on
the
basic
premis
that
there
should
be
no
bank
too
big
to
fail
and
no
individu
too
power
to
jail
We
agre
on
that
but
where
we
disagre
is
the
comment
that
senat
sander
ha
made
that
do
not
just
affect
me
I
can
take
that
but
he
critic
presid
obama
for
take
donat
from
wall
street
and
presid
obama
ha
led
our
countri
out
of
the
great
recess
senat
sander
call
him
weak
disappoint
He
even
in
2011
publicli
sought
someon
to
run
in
a
primari
against
presid
obama
now
I
person
believ
that
presid
obama
work
to
push
through
the
dodd-frank
[laughter]
the
dodd-frank
bill
and
then
to
sign
it
wa
one
of
the
most
import
regulatori
scheme
we
have
had
sinc
the
1930
So
i am
go
to
defend
dodd-frank
and
i am
go
to
defend
presid
obama
for
take
on
wall
street
take
on
the
financi
industri
and
get
result
[applause]
senat
sander
your
respons
that
time
governor
omalley[crosstalk]
I
have
a

profus
of
comment
about
your
feel
toward
presid
obama
are
a
littl
strang
given
what
you
said
about
him
in
2011
but
look
I
have
a
plan
that
most
comment
have
said
is
tougher

and
more
comprehens

on
the

becaus
I
think
the
american
public
deserv
to
know
and
you
can
go
to
my
websit
and
actual
see
that
but
there
are
seriou
question
about
how
we
are
go
to
pay
for
what
we
want
to
see
our
countri
do
and
i am
the
onli
candid
stand
here
tonight
who
ha
said
I
will
not
rais
tax
on
the
middl
class
I
want
to
rais
incom
not
tax
and
i am
go
to
do
everyth
I
can
to
make
sure
that
the
wealthi
pay
for
debt
free
tuition
for
child
care
for
paid
famili
leav
To
help
us
bring
down
student
debt
we
are
go
to
refin
that
student
debt
save
kid
thousand
of
dollar
yeah
and
that
will
also
come
out
of
the
—
some
of
the
pocket
of
peopl
in
the
financi
servic
industri
mitchell:
OK
we
are
out
of
time
senat
sander
but
I
will
tell
you
exactli
how
I
pay
for
everyth
I
have
proposed[crosstalk]
mitchell:
senat
sander
here
is
the
main
two
point
mitchell:
senat
sander
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
tax
yeah
mitchell:
the
most
googl
polit
issu
I
got
it
mitchell:
In
the
last
month
wa
tax
now
in
your
healthcar
plan
the
plan
you
releas
tonight
you
would
not
onli
rais
tax
on
the
wealthi
but
the
detail
you
releas
indic
you
would
rais
tax
on
the
middl
class
also
Is
that
correct?
what
is
correct
and
i am
disappoint
that
secretari
clinton
campaign
ha
made
thi
critic
it
a
republican
critic
secretari
clinton
doe
know
a
lot
about
healthcar
and
she
understand
I
believ
that
a
medicar
for
all
singl
payer
program
will
substanti
lower
the
cost
of
healthcar
for
middl
class
famili
So
what
we
have
got
to
acknowledg
and
I
hope
the
secretari
doe
is
we
are
do
away
with
privat
health
insur
premium
So
instead
of
pay
$10000
dollar
to
blue
cross
or
blue
shield
ye
some
middl
class
famili
would
be
pay
slightli
more
in
tax
but
the
result
would
be
that
that
middl
class
famili
would
be
save
some
$5000
dollar
in
healthcar
cost
A
littl
bit
more
in
tax
do
away
with
privat
health
insur
premium
it
a
pretti
good
deal
[applause]
mitchell:
senat
—
senat
let
me
just
follow
up
on
that
No
it
is
not
break
my
word
when
you
are
—
it
one
thing
to
say
i am
rais
tax
it
anoth
thing
to
say
that
we
are
do
away
with
privat
health
insur
premium
So
if
I
save
you
$10000
in
privat
health
insur
and
you
pay
a
littl
bit
more
in
tax
in
total
there
are
huge
save
in
what
your
famili
is
spend
omalley:
senat
i am
the
onli
person
on
thi
stage
that
actual
balanc
a
budget
everi
year
for
15
year
senat
sander
american
love
their
suv
which
spike
in
sale
last
year
as
ga
price
plummet
how
do
you
convinc
american
that
the
problem
of
climat
chang
is
so
urgent
that
they
need
to
chang
their
behavior?
that
time
We
are
go
to
take
a
break
charleston
andrea
mitchel
ha
question
now
start
with
iran
mitchell:
thank
you
lester
senat
sander
the
nuclear
deal
is
now
enforc
iran
is
get
it
billion
of
dollar
sever
american
who
have
been
held
are
now
go
to
be
head
home
the
presid
said
today
"it
a
good
day
it
a
good
day
for
diplomaci
it
a
time
now
to
restor
diplomat
relat
for
the
first
time
sinc
1979
and
actual
re-
open
a
US
embassi
in
tehran"
well
i am
veri
proud
of
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
I
wa
veri
pleas
to
be
part
of
what
the
presid
put
into
action
when
he
took
offic
I
wa
respons
for
get
those
sanction
impos
which
put
the
pressur
on
iran
It
brought
them
to
the
negoti
tabl
which
result
in
thi
agreement
and
so
they
have
been
so
far
follow
their
requir
under
the
agreement
but
I
think
we
still
have
to
care
watch
them
We
have
had
one
good
day
over
36
year
and
I
think
we
need
more
good
day
befor
we
move
more
rapidli
toward
ani
kind
of
normal
and
we
have
to
be
sure
that
they
are
truli
go
to
implement
the
agreement
and
then
we
have
to
go
after
them
on
a
lot
of
their
other
bad
behavior
in
the
region
which
is
caus
enorm
problem
in
syria
yemen
iraq
and
elsewher
mitchell:
you
mention
syria
let
me
ask
you
about
syria
all
of
you
let
turn
to
syria
and
the
civil
war
that
ha
been
rage
there
are
there
ani
circumst
in
which
you
could
see
deploy
signific
number
of
ground
forc
in
syria
not
just
special
forc
but
signific
ground
forc
to
combat
isi
in
a
direct
combat
role?
let
me
start
with
you
secretari
clinton
absolut
not
I
have
a
three
point
plan
that
doe
not
includ
american
ground
forc
It
includ
the
unit
state
lead
an
air
coalit
which
is
what
we
are
do
support
fighter
on
the
ground;
the
iraqi
armi
which
is
begin
to
show
more
abil
the
sunni
fighter
that
we
are
now
help
to
reconstitut
and
kurdish
on
both
side
of
the
border
I
think
we
also
have
tri
to
disrupt
their
suppli
chain
of
foreign
fighter
and
foreign
money
and
we
do
have
to
contest
them
in
onlin
space
So
i am
veri
commit
to
both
go
after
isi
but
also
support
what
secretari
kerri
is
do
to
tri
to
move
on
a
polit
diplomat
to
tri
to
begin
to
slow
down
and
hope
end
the
carnag
in
syria
which
is
the
root
of
so
mani
of
the
problem
that
we
seen
in
the
region
and
beyond
mitchell:
senat
sander
ground
forc
ye
or
no?
As
everybodi
you
know
thi
is
incred
complic
and
difficult
issu
and
I
applaud
I
know
presid
obama
been
get
a
lot
of
critic
on
thi
I
think
he
is
do
the
right
thing
what
the
nightmar
is
which
mani
of
my
republican
colleagu
appear
to
want
is
to
not
have
learn
the
lesson
of
iraq
To
get
american
young
men
and
women
involv
in
perpetu
warfar
in
the
quagmir
of
syria
and
the
middl
east
would
be
an
unmitig
disast
that
as
presid
I
will
do
everyth
in
my
power
to
avoid
omalley:
andrea
mitchell:
governor
omalley?
We
should
—
we
should
learn
—
we
should
learn
from
king
abdullah
of
jordan
one
of
the
few
hero
in
a
veri
unhero
place
and
what
abdullah
said
is
thi
is
a
war
with
a
soul
of
islam
and
that
muslim
troop
should
be
on
the
ground
with
our
support
and
the
support
of
other
major
countri
that
is
how
we
destroy
isi
not
with
american
troop
in
perpetu
warfar
mitchell:
governor
omalley
omalley:
thank
you
[applause]
andrea
governor
have
led
us
to
victori
in
two
world
war
by
do
what
america
doe
best
and
that
is
by
join
forc
with
other
by
act
in
coalit
and
I
believ
that
presid
obama
is
do
the
right
thing
in
thi
case
We
need
to
learn
the
lesson
from
the
past
We
do
need
to
provid
the
special
—
special
op
advis
we
need
—
do
need
to
provid
the
technic
support
but
over
the
long-term
we
need
to
develop
new
allianc
We
need
a
much
more
proactiv
nation
secur
strategi
that
reduc
these
threat
befor
they
rise
to
a
level
where
it
feel
like
we
need
to
pull
for
a
divis
of
marin
and
I
also
want
to
add
one
other
thing
here
I
appreci
the
fact
that
in
our
debat
we
do
not
use
the
term
you
hear
republican
throw
around
tri
to
look
all
vibrato
and
macho
send
other
kid
—
kid
into
combat
they
keep
use
the
term
boot
on
the
ground
A
woman
in
burlington
iowa
said
to
me
"governor
when
you
are
with
your
colleagu
pleas
do
not
refer
to
my
son
who
ha
serv
two
tour
of
duti
in
iraq
as
a
pair
of
boot
on
the
ground"
now
we
need
to
be
mind
of
learn
the
lesson
of
the
past
[applause]
mitchell:
I
have
a
question
I
have
a
question
for
senat
sander
did
the
polici
of
the
obama
administr
in
which
secretari
clinton
of
cours
wa
a
part
creat
a
vacuum
in
iraq
and
syria
that
help
isi
grow?
well
—
but
—
but
mitchell:
line?
did
it
hurt
US
credibility?
I
think
as
command
in
chief
you
have
got
to
constantli
be
evalu
the
decis
you
have
to
make
I
know
a
littl
bit
about
thi
have
spent
mani
hour
in
the
situat
room
advis
presid
obama
and
I
want
to
just
add
to
someth
that
senat
sander
said
the
unit
state
had
a
veri
big
interest
in
tri
to
help
stabil
the
region
If
there
is
ani
blame
to
be
spread
around
it
start
with
the
prime
minist
of
iraq
who
sectarian
hi
militari
set
shia
against
sunni
It
is
amplifi
by
assad
who
ha
wage
one
of
the
bloodiest
most
terribl
attack
on
hi
own
people:
250,000-plu
dead
million
flee
caus
thi
vacuum
that
ha
been
fill
unfortun
by
terrorist
group
includ
isi
So
I
think
we
are
in
the
midst
of
great
turmoil
in
thi
region
We
have
a
proxi
conflict
go
on
between
saudi
arabia
and
iran
you
know
one
of
the
critic
I
have
had
of
senat
sander
is
hi
suggest
that
you
know
iranian
troop
be
use
to
tri
to
end
the
war
in
syria
mitchell:
your
time
is
up
and
go
after
isi
which
I
do
not
think
would
be
a
good
idea
let
me
just
mitchell:
senat
but
overal
a
lot
of
the
forc
at
work
in
the
region
are
one
that
we
cannot
directli
influenc
but
we
can
