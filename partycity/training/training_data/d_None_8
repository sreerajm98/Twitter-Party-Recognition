let u
turn

thank

[applause]
thank
you
senat
sander
secretari
clinton
and
welcom
back
to
thi
pb
newshour
debat
democrat
debat
here
in
milwauke
let
get
right
to
the
question
senat
sander
to
you
first
come
off
the
result
in
iowa
and
new
hampshir
there
are
mani
voter
who
are
take
a
closer
look
at
you
and
your
idea
and
they
are
ask
how
big
a
role
do
you
forese
for
the
feder
government?
it
alreadi
spend
21%
of
the
entir
US
economi
how
much
larger
would
govern
be
in
the
live
of
american
under
a
sander
presidency?
but
my
question
is
how
big
would
govern
be?
would
there
be
ani
limit
on
the
size
of
the
role
of
govern
Of
cours
there
will
be
a
limit
but
when
today
you
have
massiv
level
of
incom
and
wealth
inequ
when
the
middl
class
is
disappear
you
have
the
highest
rate
of
child
poverti
of
almost
ani
major
countri
on
earth
ye
in
my
view
the
govern
of
a
democrat
societi
ha
a
moral
respons
to
play
a
vital
role
in
make
sure
all
of
our
peopl
have
a
decent
standard
of
live
judi
I
think
that
the
best
analysi
that
I
have
seen
base
on
senat
sander
plan
is
that
it
would
probabl
increas
the
size
of
the
feder
govern
by
about
40%
but
what
is
most
concern
to
me
is
that
in
look
at
the
plan
—
let u
take
healthcar
for
exampl
last
week
in
a
cnn
town
hall
the
senat
told
a
question
that
the
question
would
spend
about
$500
dollar
in
tax
to
get
about
$5000
dollar
in
healthcar
everi
progress
economist
who
ha
analyz
that
say
that
the
number
do
not
add
up
and
that
a
promis
that
cannot
be
kept
and
it
realli
import
now
that
we
are
get
into
the
rest
of
the
countri
that
both
of
us
are
held
to
account
for
explain
what
we
are
propos
becaus
especi
with
healthcar
thi
is
not
about
math
thi
is
about
peopl
live
and
we
should
level
with
the
american
peopl
about
what
we
can
do
to
make
sure
they
get
qualiti
afford
healthcar
well
let
us
level
with
the
american
peopl
secretari
clinton
ha
been
go
around
the
countri
say
berni
sander
want
to
dismantl
the
afford
care
act
peopl
are
go
to
lose
their
medicaid
they
are
go
to
lose
their
chip
program
I
have
fought
my
entir
life
to
make
sure
that
healthcar
is
a
right
for
all
peopl
We
are
not
go
to
dismantl
everyth
but
here
is
the
truth
twenty-nin
million
peopl
have
no
health
insur
today
in
america
We
pay
by
far
the
highest
price
in
the
world
for
prescript
drug
one
out
of
five
american
can not
even
afford
the
prescript
their
doctor
are
write
million
of
peopl
have
high
deduct
and
co-pay
what
I
said
and
let
me
repeat
it
I
do
not
know
what
economist
secretari
clinton
is
talk
to
but
what
I
have
said
and
let
me
repeat
it
that
ye
the
middl
—
the
famili
right
in
the
middl
of
the
economi
would
pay
$500
dollar
more
in
tax
and
get
a
reduct
in
their
healthcar
cost
of
$5000
dollar
In
my
view
healthcar
is
a
right
of
all
peopl
not
a
privileg
and
I
will
fight
for
that[applause]
final
thought
senat
that
is
absolut
inaccur
look
here
is
the
realiti
folk
there
is
one
major
countri
on
earth
that
doe
not
guarante
health
care
to
all
peopl
there
is
one
major
countri
—
the
unit
state
—
which
end
up
spend
almost
three
time
per
capita
what
they
do
in
the
UK
guarante
health
care
to
all
peopl
50
percent
more
than
they
do
in
franc
guarante
health
care
to
all
peopl
far
more
than
our
canadian
neighbor
who
guarante
health
care
to
all
peopl
pleas
do
not
tell
me
that
in
thi
countri
if
—
and
here
the
if
—
we
have
the
courag
to
take
on
the
drug
compani
and
have
the
courag
to
take
on
the
insur
compani
and
the
medic
equip
supplier
if
we
do
that
ye
we
can
guarante
health
care
to
all
peopl
in
a
much
more
cost
effect
way
Id
like
to
move
along
Id
like

might
—

have
propos
fairli
expans
idea
about

you
may
rememb
thi
pledg
from
a
state
of
the
union
address
at
which
I
believ
you
were
present
in
which
these
word
were
said:
"the
era
of
big
govern
is
over"
you
may
rememb
that
when
ask
your
feel
about
the
feder
govern
thi
week
61
percent
of
new
hampshir
democrat
told
exit
pollster
that
they
are
angri
or
at
least
dissatisfi
given
what
you
and
senat
sander
are
propos
an
expand
govern
in
almost
everi
area
of
our
live
is
it
fair
for
american
who
fear
govern
to
fear
you?
but
I
have
not
heard
either
of
you
put
a
price
tag
on
your
—
you
say[crosstalk]
senator?
next
we
are
go
to
veri
brief
thank
you
As
you
know
just
quickli
as
you
know
your
strong
support
former
secretari
of

madelein
albright
said
the
other
day
that
there
a
special
place
in
hell
for

not
support
other
women
Do

agre
with
what
she
said?
senat

in
the
minor
but
we
still
want
to
hear
from
you
[laughter]
senat
do
you
worri
at
all
that

the
instrument
of
thwart
histori
as
senat

keep
claim
that
she
might
be
the
first
woman
president?
well
you
know
I
think
from
a
histor
point
of
view
somebodi
with
my
background
somebodi
with
my
view
somebodi
who
ha
spent
hi
entir
life
take
on
the
big
money
interest
I
think
a
sander
victori
would
be
of
some
histor
accomplish
as
well
[applause]
final
comment
thank
you
both
We
turn
now
to
the
first
of
sever
question
from
our
partner
at
facebook
they
were
select
from
a
curat
group
of
peopl
we
have
been
follow
of
undecid
voter
the
first
come
from
claudia
looz
a
54-year-old
woman
who
work
as
a
program
manag
at
a
public
affair
cabl
network
in
madison
wisconsin
and
she
writes:
"wisconsin
is
number
one
in
african-american
male
incarcer
accord
to
a
univers
of
wisconsin
studi
they
found
that
wisconsin
incarcer
rate
for
black
men
which
is
at
13
percent
wa
nearli
doubl
the
countri
rate
what
can
we
do
across
the
nation
to
address
this?"
senat
sander
thi
is
one
of
the
great
tragedi
in
our
countri
today
and
we
can
no
longer
continu
to
sweep
it
under
the
rug
It
ha
to
be
dealt
with
today
a
male
african-american
babi
born
today
stand
a
one-in-four
chanc
of
end
up
in
jail
that
is
beyond
unspeak
So
what
we
have
to
do
is
the
radic
reform
of
a
broken
crimin
justic
system
[applause]
what
we
have
to
do
is
end
over-pol
in
african-american
neighborhood
the
realiti
is
that
both
the
african-american
commun
and
the
white
commun
do
marijuana
at
about
equal
rate
the
realiti
is
four
time
as
mani
black
get
arrest
for
marijuana
truth
is
that
far
more
black
get
stop
for
traffic
violat
the
truth
is
that
sentenc
for
black
is
higher
than
for
white
We
need
fundament
polic
reform
clearli
clearli
when
we
talk
about
a
crimin
justic
system
I
would
hope
that
we
could
all
agre
that
we
are
sick
and
tire
of
see
video
on
televis
of
unarm
peopl
often
african-american
shot
by
polic
offic
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
make
it
clear
that
ani
polic
offic
who
break
the
law
will
in
fact
be
held
account
[applause]
you
know
I
complet
agre
with
senat
sander
the
first
speech
I
gave
in
thi
campaign
back
in
april
wa
about
crimin
justic
reform
and
end
the
era
of
mass
incarcer
the
statist
from
wisconsin
are
particularli
troubl
becaus
it
is
the
highest
rate
of
incarcer
for
african-american
in
our
nation
twice
the
nation
averag
and
we
know
of
the
tragic
terribl
event
that
lead
to
the
death
of
dontr
hamilton
right
here
in
milwauke
a
young
man
unarm
who
should
still
be
with
us
hi
famili
certainli
believ
that
and
so
do
I
So
we
have
work
to
do
there
have
been
some
good
recommend
about
what
need
to
happen
presid
obama
polic
commiss
came
out
with
some
I
have
fulli
endors
those
but
we
have
to
restor
polic
that
will
actual
protect
the
commun
that
polic
offic
are
sworn
to
protect
and
then
we
have
to
go
after
sentenc
and
that
one
of
the
problem
here
in
wisconsin
becaus
so
much
of
what
happen
in
the
crimin
justic
system
doe
not
happen
at
the
feder
level
it
happen
at
the
state
and
local
level
but
I
would
also
add
thi
there
are
other
racial
discrep
realli
system
racism
in
thi
state
as
in
other
educ
in
employ
in
the
kind
of
factor
that
too
often
lead
from
a
posit
where
young
peopl
particularli
young
men
are
push
out
of
school
earli
are
deni
employ
opportun
So
when
we
talk
about
crimin
justic
reform
and
end
the
era
of
mass
incarcer
we
also
have
to
talk
about
job
educ
hous
and
other
way
of
help
commun
[applause]
senat
sanders?
[applause]
So
race
relat
wa
be
better
under
a
sander
presid
than
they
have
been?
let
me
turn
thi
on
it
head
becaus
when
we
talk
about
race
in
thi
countri
we
alway
talk
about
african-american
peopl
of
color
I
want
to
talk
about
white
peopl
ok?
I
know
[laughter]
So
mani
peopl
will
be
surpris
to
find
out
that
we
are
sit
in
one
of
the
most
racial
polar
metropolitan
area
in
the
countri
By
the
middl
of
thi
centuri
the
nation
is
go
to
be
major
nonwhit
our
public
school
are
alreadi
there
If
working-class
white
american
are
about
to
be
outnumb
are
alreadi
underemploy
in
mani
case
and
one
studi
found
they
are
die
sooner
do
not
they
have
a
reason
to
be
resent
senat
—
secretari
clinton?
senat
—
senat
I
want
you
to
respond
to
that
but
I
also
want
you
to
—
am
I
wrong?
Is
it
even
right
to
be
describ
thi
as
a
matter
of
race?
thank
you
senat
sander
one
of
the
caus
of
anxieti
for
work
class
american
is
connect
to
immigr
presid
obama
as
you
know
ha
issu
execut
action
to
permit
some
5
million
undocu
immigr
who
are
live
now
in
the
unit
state
to
come
out
of
the
shadow
without
fear
of
deport
to
get
work
permit
would
you
go
further
than
that?
and
if
so
how
specif
would
you
do
it?
should
an
undocu
famili
watch
thi
debat
tonight
say
in
nevada
rest
easi
not
fear
of
further
deport
under
a
sander
presidency?
the
answer
is
ye
We
have
got
11
million
undocu
peopl
in
thi
countri
I
have
talk
to
some
of
the
young
kid
with
tear
roll
down
their
cheek
are
scare
to
death
that
today
they
may
or
their
parent
may
be
deport
I
believ
that
we
have
got
to
pass
comprehens
immigr
reform
someth
that
I
strongli
support
I
believ
that
we
have
got
to
move
toward
a
path
toward
citizenship
I
agre
with
presid
obama
who
use
execut
order
to
protect
famili
becaus
the
congress
the
hous
wa
unabl
or
refus
to
act
and
in
fact
I
would
go
further
what
would
motiv
me
and
what
would
be
the
guid
light
for
me
in
term
of
immigr
reform
judi
is
to
bring
famili
togeth
not
divid
them
up
and
let
me
say
thi
also
somebodi
who
is
veri
fond
of
the
presid
agre
with
him
most
of
the
time
I
disagre
with
hi
recent
deport
polici
and
I
would
not
support
those
bottom
line
is
a
path
toward
citizenship
for
11
million
undocu
peopl
if
congress
doe
not
do
the
right
thing
we
use
the
execut
order
of
the
presid
[applause]
I
strongli
support
the
presid
execut
action
I
hope
the
suprem
court
uphold
them
I
think
there
is
constitut
and
legal
author
for
the
presid
to
have
done
what
he
did
I
am
against
the
raid
i am
against
the
kind
of
inhuman
treatment
that
is
now
be
visit
upon
famili
wake
them
up
in
the
middl
of
the
night
round
them
up
We
should
be
deport
crimin
not
hardwork
immigr
famili
who
do
the
veri
best
they
can
and
often
are
keep
economi
go
in
mani
place
in
our
countri
i am
a
strong
support
of
comprehens
immigr
reform
have
been
ever
sinc
I
wa
in
the
senat
I
wa
one
of
the
origin
sponsor
of
the
dream
act
I
vote
for
comprehens
immigr
reform
in
2007
senat
sander
vote
against
it
at
that
time
becaus
I
think
we
have
to
get
to
comprehens
immigr
reform
with
a
path
to
citizenship
and
as
presid
I
would
expand
enorm
energi
liter
call
everi
member
of
congress
that
I
thought
I
could
persuad
hope
after
the
2016
elect
some
of
the
republican
will
come
to
their
sens
and
realiz
we
are
not
go
to
deport
11
or
12
million
peopl
in
thi
countri
and
they
will
work
with
me
to
get
comprehens
immigr
reform[applause]
secretari
clinton
I
do
have
a
disagr
here
If
my
memori
is
correct
I
think
when
we
saw
children
come
from
these
horrend
horrend
violent
area
of
hondura
and
neighbor
countri
peopl
who
are
flee
drug
violenc
and
cartel
violenc
I
thought
it
wa
a
good
idea
to
allow
those
children
to
stay
in
thi
countri
that
wa
not
as
I
understand
it
the
secretari
posit
In
term
of
2007
immigr
reform
yeah
I
did
vote
against
it
I
vote
against
it
becaus
the
southern
poverti
law
center
among
other
group
said
that
the
guest-work
program
that
were
embed
in
thi
agreement
were
akin
to
slaveri
akin
to
slaveri
where
peopl
came
into
thi
countri
to
do
guest
work
were
abus
were
exploit
and
if
they
stood
up
for
their
right
theyd
be
thrown
out
of
thi
countri
So
it
wa
not
just
me
who
oppos
it
It
wa
lulac
one
of
the
larg
latino
organ
in
thi
countri
It
wa
the
afl-cio
It
wa
some
of
the
most
progress
member
of
the
unit
state
congress
who
oppos
it
for
that
reason
but
we
are
where
we
are
right
now
and
where
we
are
right
now
is
we
have
got
to
stand
up
to
the
trump
of
the
world
who
are
tri
to
divid
us
up
what
we
have
to
do
right
now
is
bring
our
peopl
togeth
and
understand
that
we
must
provid
a
path
toward
citizenship
for
11
million
undocu
peopl
Id
like
well
let
me
just
respond
I
work
with
ted
kennedi
He
wa
the
chairman
of
my
committe
and
I
love
ted

thi
issu
when
you
have
one
of
the
larg
latino
organ
in
america

start
with
you
senat

OK
you
know
you
judg
a
nation
not
by
the
number
of
millionair
and
billionair
it
ha
but
by
how
you
treat
we
treat
the
most
vulner
and
fragil
peopl
in
our
nation
and
by
those
standard
we
are
not
do
particularli
well
We
have
the
highest
rate
of
childhood
poverti
among
almost
ani
major
countri
on
earth
and
in
term
of
senior
there
are
million
of
senior
—
and
I
have
talk
to
them
in
my
state
of
vermont
and
all
over
thi
countri
—
who
are
tri
to
get
by
on
$11000
$12000
$13000
a
year
social
secur
and
you
know
what?
you
do
the
arithmet
you
can not
get
by
on
$11000
$12000
$13000
a
year
and
here
an
area
where
secretari
clinton
and
I
believ
we
have
a
differ
I
have
long
support
the
proposit
that
we
should
lift
the
cap
on
taxabl
incom
come
into
the
social
secur
trust
fund
start
at
$250000
[applause]
and
when
we
—
and
when
we
do
that
we
do
not
do
what
the
republican
want
which
is
to
cut
social
secur
We
do
what
the
american
peopl
want
to
expand
social
secur
by
$1300
a
year
for
peopl
under
$16000
and
we
extend
the
life
of
social
secur
for
58
year
ye
the
wealthiest
peopl
the
top
15
percent
will
pay
more
in
tax
but
a
great
nation
like
our
should
not
be
in
a
posit
where
elderli
peopl
are
cut
their
pill
in
half
where
they
do
not
have
decent
nutrit
where
they
can not
heat
their
home
in
the
wintertim
that
is
not
what
america
should
be
about
If
elect
presid
I
will
do
everyth
I
can
to
expand
social
secur
benefit
not
just
for
senior
but
for
disabl
veteran
as
well
[applause]
I
think
—
I
think
it
fair
to
say
we
do
not
have
a
disagr
We
both
believ
there
ha
to
be
more
money
go
into
the
social
secur
system
I
have
said
i am
look
at
a
coupl
of
differ
way
one
which
you
mention
senat
but
also
tri
to
expand
the
exist
tax
to
passiv
incom
that
wealthi
peopl
have
so
that
we
do
get
more
revenu
into
the
social
secur
trust
fund
I
have
a
slightli
differ
approach
though
about
what
we
should
do
with
that
initi
first
rather
than
expand
benefit
for
everyon
I
do
want
to
take
care
of
low-incom
senior
who
work
at
low-wag
job
I
want
to
take
care
of
women
when
the
social
secur
program
wa
start
in
the
1930
not
veri
mani
women
work
and
women
have
been
disadvantag
ever
sinc
they
do
not
get
ani
credit
for
their
care-tak
respons
and
the
peopl
who
are
often
the
most
hard-hit
are
widow
becaus
when
their
spous
die
they
can
lose
up
to
one-half
of
their
social
secur
monthli
payment
So
we
have
no
disagr
about
the
need
to
buttress
social
secur
get
more
revenu
into
the
program
but
I
want
to
start
by
help
those
peopl
who
are
most
at
risk
the
one
who
ye
are
cut
their
pill
in
half
who
do
not
believ
they
can
make
the
rent
who
are
worri
about
what
come
next
for
them
well
senat
look
I
think
we
are
in
vigor
agreement
here
We
both
want
to
get
more
revenu
in
I
have
yet
to

the

I
think
that
the

into
thi
is
that
if
you
had

which
now

If

So
let u

He

I

to

a

do
the
kind
of
analysi
that
would
rebuild

a

what
we

that
what
I
intend
to
do
We
spent
the
first

of
thi

talk
about
domest
insecur
the
second
part
we
want
to
talk
about
our
foreign
polici
insecur
and
we
want
to
start
with
a
question
for
you
secretari

about
america

in

senat
sander
let
me
—
let
me
just
say
thi
what
a
presid
of
the
unit
state
ha
got
to
do
and
what
is
hi
or
her
major
I
think
respons
is
to
a
make
certain
that
we
keep
our
peopl
safe
that
we
work
with
alli
around
the
world
to
protect
democrat
valu
that
we
do
all
that
we
can
to
creat
a
world
of
peac
and
prosper
I
vote
against
the
war
in
iraq
becaus
I
listen
veri
care
to
what
presid
bush
and
vice
presid
cheney
had
to
say
and
I
did
not
believ
them
and
if
you
go
to
my
web
siteberniesanderscom
what
you
find
is
not
onli
go
to
help
lead
the
opposit
to
that
war
but
much
of
what
I
fear
would
happen
when
I
spoke
on
the
floor
of
the
hous
in
fact
did
happen
in
term
of
the
instabl
that
occur
now
I
think
an
area
in
kind
of
a
vagu
way
or
not
so
vagu
where
secretari
clinton
and
I
disagre
is
the
area
of
regim
chang
look
the
truth
is
that
a
power
nation
like
the
unit
state
certainli
work
with
our
alli
we
can
overthrow
dictat
all
over
the
world
and
god
onli
know
saddam
hussein
wa
a
brutal
dictat
We
could
overthrow
assad
tomorrow
if
we
want
to
We
got
rid
of
gadhafi
but
the
point
about
foreign
polici
is
not
just
to
know
that
you
can
overthrow
a
terribl
dictat
it
to
understand
what
happen
the
day
after
and
in
libya
for
exampl
the
unit
state
secretari
clinton
as
secretari
of
state
work
with
some
other
countri
did
get
rid
of
a
terribl
dictat

gadhafi
but
what
happen
is
a
polit
vacuum
develop
isi
came
in
and
now
occupi
signific
territori
in
libya
and
is
now
prepar
unless
we
stop
them
to
have
a
terrorist

but
thi
is
noth
new
thi
ha
gone
on
50
or
60
year
where
the

ha
been

He

as
a
result
of
that
the

came
in

the
result
of
that
you
had
the
iranian
revolut
come
in
and
that
is
where
we
are
today

So
I

as

I
will
look

about

I
will
do
everyth
I
can
to
make

you
did
support
a
UN
secur

approach
which
we
did
follow
up

I
think
it

to

that
is
well
it
ai
not
henri
kissing
that
for
sure
that
fine
that
fine
[laughter]
you
know
I
listen
to
a
wide
varieti
of
voic
that
have
expertis
in
variou
area
I
think
it
is
fair
to
say
whatev
the
complaint
that
you
want
to
make
about
him
are
that
with
respect
to
china
one
of
the
most
challeng
relationship
we
have
hi
open
up
china
and
hi
ongo
relationship
with
the
leader
of
china
is
an
incred
use
relationship
for
the
unit
state
of
america
[applause]
So
if
we
want
to
pick
and
choos
—
and
I
certainli
do
—
peopl
I
listen
to
peopl
I
do
not
listen
to
peopl
I
listen
to
for
certain
area
then
I
think
we
have
to
be
fair
and
look
at
the
entir
world
becaus
it
a
big
complic
world
out
there
It
is
and
ye
peopl
we
may
disagre
with
on
a
number
of
thing
may
have
some
insight
may
have
some
relationship
that
are
import
for
the
presid
to
understand
in
order
to
best
protect
the
unit
state
[applause]
senat
let
me
—
let
me
move
on
to
anoth
countri
with
which
the
US
ha
a
complic
relationship
senat
sander
and
that
russia
On
the
one
hand
we
are
awar
that
russia
is
a
countri
that
the
unit
state
need
to
cooper
with
just
tonight
secretari
of
state
john
kerri
ha
announc
what
appear
to
be
an
agreement
with
the
russian
to
lead
—
that
could
lead
toward
a
ceasefir
in
syria
would
be
the
first
cessat
of
conflict
in
that
countri
in
that
civil
war
in
five
year
but
it
come
at
a
veri
high
price
becaus
not
onli
have
all
—
have
we
seen
the
death
the
remov
of
so
mani
peopl
million
of
peopl
we
now
see
the
russian
in
the
last
few
week
have
bomb
in
a
way
that
benefit
presid
assad
ha
not
gone
after
isi
So
my
question
to
you
is
when
it
come
to
deal
with
russia
are
you
prepar
—
how
hard
are
you
prepar
to
be?
are
you
prepar
to
institut
further
econom
sanctions?
would
you
be
prepar
to
move
militarili
if
russia
move
on
eastern
europe?
It
seem
to
me
that
russia
recent
ha
gotten
the
better
of
the
unit
state
well
thi
is
what
I
would
say
It
is
a
complic
relationship
I
congratul
secretari
of
state
john
kerri
and
the
presid
for
work
on
thi
agreement
As
you
have
indic
what
is
happen
in
syria
the
number
of
peopl
the
hundr
of
thousand
of
peopl
who
have
been
kill
—
men
women
20,000
children
the
peopl
who
are
forc
to
flee
their
own
countri
—
their
own
countri
—
it
is
unspeak
It
is
a
real
horror
now
what
I
think
is
that
right
now
we
have
got
to
do
our
best
in
develop
posit
relat
with
russia
but
let u
be
clear:
russia
aggress
action
in
the
crimea
and
in
ukrain
have
brought
about
a
situat
where
presid
obama
and
nato
—
correctli
I
believ
—
are
say
you
know
what
we
are
go
to
have
to
beef
up
our
troop
level
in
that
part
of
the
world
to
tell
putin
that
hi
aggress
is
not
go
to
go
unmatch
that
he
is
not
go
to
get
away
with
aggress
action
I
happen
to
believ
that
putin
is
do
what
he
is
do
becaus
hi
economi
is
increasingli
in
shambl
and
he
tri
to
ralli
hi
peopl
in
support
of
him
but
bottom
line
is:
the
presid
is
right
We
have
to
put
more
money
We
have
to
work
with
nato
to
protect
eastern
europ
against
ani
kind
of
russian
aggress
well
with
respect
to
syria
I
realli
do
appreci
the
effort
that
secretari
kerri
ha
made
the
agreement
on
humanitarian
relief
now
need
to
be
implement
becaus
there
are
enclav
that
are
liter
fill
with
starv
peopl
throughout
syria
the
agreement
on
a
cease-fir
though
is
someth
that
ha
to
be
implement
more
quickli
than
the
schedul
that
the
russian
agre
to
you
know
the
russian
want
to
buy
time
are
they
buy
time
to
continu
their
bombard
on
behalf
of
the
assad
regim
to
further
decim
what
left
of
the
opposit
which
would
be
a
grave
disservic
to
ani
kind
of
eventu
cease-fire?
So
I
know
secretari
kerri
is
work
extrem
hard
to
tri
to
move
that
cease-fir
up
as
quickli
as
possibl
but
I
would
add
thi
you
know
the
secur
council
final
got
around
to
adopt
a
resolut
At
the
core
of
that
resolut
is
an
agreement
I
negoti
in
june
of
2012
in
geneva
which
set
forth
a
cease-fir
and
move
toward
a
polit
resolut
tri
to
bring
the
parti
at
stake
in
syria
togeth
thi
is
incred
complic
becaus
we
have
got
iran
as
a
big
player
in
addit
to
russia
We
have
saudi
arabia
turkey
and
other
who
have
veri
import
interest
in
their
view
thi
is
one
of
the
area
I
have
disagre
with
senat
sander
on
who
ha
call
for
iranian
troop
tri
to
end
civil
war
in
syria
which
I
think
would
be
a
grave
mistak
put
iranian
troop
right
on
the
border
of
the
golan
right
next
to
israel
would
be
a
nonstart
for
me
tri
to
get
iran
and
saudi
arabia
to
work
togeth
as
he
ha
suggest
in
the
past
is
equal
a
nonstart
So
let u
support
what
secretari
kerri
and
the
presid
are
do
but
let u
hope
that
we
can
acceler
the
cease-fir
becaus
I
fear
that
the
russian
will
continu
their
bomb
tri
to
do
everyth
they
can
to
destroy
what
left
of
the
opposit
and
rememb
the
russian
have
not
gone
after
isi
or
ani
of
the
other
terrorist
group
So
as
we
get
a
cease-fir
and
mayb
some
humanitarian
corridor
that
still
leav
the
terrorist
group
on
the
doorstep
of
other
in
syria
turkey
lebanon
jordan
and
the
like
So
we
have
got
some
real
work
to
do
and
let u
tri
to
make
sure
we
actual
implement
what
ha
been
agre
to
with
the
russian
[applause]
let
me
just
—
just
say
thi
for
a
start
the
secretari
and
I
disagre
—
and
I
think
the
presid
doe
not
agre
with
her
—
in
term
of
the
concept
of
a
no-fli
zone
in
syria
I
think
you
do
have
a
humanitarian
tragedi
there
as
I
mention
a
moment
ago
I
applaud
secretari
kerri
and
the
presid
for
tri
to
put
togeth
thi
agreement
let
hope
that
it
hold
but
furthermor
what
we
have
got
to
do
i am
sorri
ye
I
do
believ
that
we
have
got
to
do
everyth
that
we
can
and
it
will
not
happen
tomorrow
but
I
do
hope
that
in
year
to
come
just
as
occur
with
cuba
10
20
year
ago
peopl
would
say
reach
normal
relat
with
cuba
and
by
the
way
I
hope
we
can
end
the
trade
embargo
with
cuba
as
well
but
the
idea
that
we
some
day
mayb
have
decent
relat
with
iran
mayb
put
pressur
on
them
so
they
end
their
support
for
terror
around
the
world
ye
that
is
someth
I
want
to
achiev
and
I
believ
that
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
be
aggress
to
be
principl
but
to
have
the
goal
of
tri
to
improv
relat
that
how
you
make
peac
in
the
world
you
sit
down
and
you
work
with
peopl
you
make
demand
of
peopl
in
thi
case
demand
iran
stop
the
support
of
intern
terror
[applause]
well
I
respect
disagre
I
think
we
have
achiev
a
great
deal
with
the
iranian
nuclear
agreement
to
put
a
lid
on
the
iranian
nuclear
weapon
program
that
ha
to
be
enforc
absolut
with
consequ
for
iran
at
the
slightest
deviat
from
their
requir
under
the
agreement
I
do
not
think
we
should
promis
or
even
look
toward
normal
relat
becaus
we
have
a
lot
of
other
busi
to
get
done
with
iran
ye
they
have
to
stop
be
the
main
state
sponsor
of
terror
ye
they
have
to
stop
tri
to
destabil
the
middl
east
caus
even
more
chao
ye
they
have
got
to
get
out
of
syria
they
have
got
to
quit
sponsor
hezbollah
and
hama
they
have
got
to
quit
tri
to
ship
rocket
into
gaza
that
can
be
use
against
israel
We
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
with
iran
befor
we
ever
say
that
they
could
move
toward
normal
relat
with
us
[applause]
We
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
We
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
but
I
recal
when
secretari
clinton
ran
against
then-sen
obama
she
wa
critic
of
him
for
suggest
that
mayb
you
want
to
talk
to
iran
that
you
want
to
talk
to
our
enemi
I
have
no
illus
Of
cours
you
are
right
iran
is
sponsor
terror
in
mani
part
of
the
world
destabil
area
everybodi
know
that
but
our
goal
is
in
fact
to
tri
over
a
period
of
time
to
in
fact
deal
with
our
enemi
not
just
ignor
that
realiti
[crosstalk]
senat
sander
from
a
debat
in
2008
quot
what
I
said
the
question
wa
would
you
meet
with
an
adversari
without
conditions?
I
said
no
and
in
fact
in
obama
administr
we
did
not
meet
with
anybodi
without
condit
that
is
the
appropri
approach
in
order
to
get
the
result
that
you
are
seek
[applause]
let
me
move
on
you
have
both
mention
the
humanitarian
tragedi
which
have
been
an
outgrowth
in
part
of
what
ha
happen
in
syria
and
in
libya
more
than
a
million
refuge
enter
europ
in
2015
anoth
76,000
just
last
month
that
is
about
2,000
arriv
everi
day
nearli
400
peopl
have
been
lost
at
sea
so
far
thi
year
cross
the
mediterranean
and
there
are
report
that
10,000
children
are
miss
If
we
are
leader
in
thi
world
where
should
the
US
be
on
this?
what
should
the
unit
state
be
do
secretari
clinton?
well
I
wa
pleas
that
nato
announc
just
thi
week
that
they
are
go
to
start
do
patrol
in
the
mediterranean
in
the
aegean
to
tri
to
interdict
the
smuggler
to
tri
to
prevent
the
kind
of
tragedi
that
we
have
seen
all
too
often
also
to
tri
to
prevent
more
refuge
from
come
to
the
european
union
and
it
especi
signific
that
they
are
work
with
both
turkey
and
greec
in
order
to
do
thi
with
respect
to
the
unit
state
I
think
our
role
in
nato
our
support
for
the
EU
as
well
as
our
willing
to
take
refuge
so
long
as
they
are
thoroughli
vet
and
that
we
have
confid
from
intellig
and
other
sourc
that
they
can
come
to
our
countri
we
should
be
do
our
part
and
we
should
back
up
the
recent
donor
confer
to
make
sure
we
have
made
our
contribut
to
tri
to
deal
with
the
enorm
cost
that
these
refuge
are
pose
to
turkey
and
to
member
of
the
EU
in
particular
thi
is
a
humanitarian
catastroph
there
is
no
other
descript
of
it
So
we
do
as
the
unit
state
have
to
support
our
friend
our
alli
in
europ
We
have
to
stand
with
them
We
have
to
provid
financi
support
to
them
We
have
to
provid
the
nato
support
to
back
up
the
mission
that
is
go
on
and
we
have
to
take
properli
vet
refuge
ourselv
and
we
have
a
final
question
from
our
facebook
famili
and
it
goe
to
senat
sander
It
come
from
robert
andrew
he
a
40-year-old
stay-at-hom
dad
in
dover
massachusett
He
say
"the
world
ha
seen
mani
great
leader
in
the
cours
of
human
histori
can
you
name
two
leader
—
one
american
and
one
foreign
—
who
would
influenc
your
foreign
polici
decisions?
and
whi
do
you
see
them
as
—
whi
are
they
influential?"
you
know
franklin
delano
roosevelt
took
the
oath
of
offic
in
1933
at
a
time
when
25
percent
of
the
american
peopl
were
unemploy
countri
wa
in
incred
despair
and
he
stood
befor
the
american
peopl
and
he
said
"the
onli
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itself"
a
profound
statement
that
gave
the
american
peopl
the
courag
to
believ
that
ye
we
could
get
out
of
that
terribl
depress
and
then
what
he
did
is
redefin
the
role
of
govern
you
know
you
had
herbert
hoover
befor
that
say
no
we
got
to
onli
worri
about
the
deficit
So
what
if
mass
unemploy
exists?
So
what
if
children
are
go
hungry?
that
not
the
role
of
the
govern
and
when
fdr
said
"yeah
it
is"
that
we
are
go
to
use
all
of
the
resourc
that
we
have
to
creat
job
to
build
home
to
feed
peopl
to
protect
the
farmer
we
are
a
nation
which
if
we
come
togeth
there
is
noth
that
we
could
not
accomplish
and
kind
of
—
that
what
I
see
our
campaign
is
about
right
now
In
thi
particular
moment
of
seriou
crise
say
to
the
american
peopl
do
not
give
up
on
the
polit
process
do
not
listen
to
the
trump
of
the
world
and
allow
them
to
divid
us
If
we
reengag
and
get
involv
yeah
we
can
have
health
care
for
all
peopl
we
can
make
public
colleg
and
univers
tuition-fre
We
do
not
have
to
have
massiv
level
of
incom
and
wealth
inequ
In
the
same
light
as
the
foreign
leader
winston
churchil
polit
were
not
my
polit
He
wa
kind
of
a
conserv
guy
in
mani
respect
but
nobodi
can
deni
that
as
a
wartim
leader
he
ralli
the
british
peopl
when
they
stood
virtual
alon
against
the
nazi
juggernaut
and
ralli
them
and
eventu
won
an
extraordinari
victori
those
are
two
leader
that
I
admir
veri
much
[applause]
I
certainli
agre
with
fdr
for
all
the
reason
senat
sander
said
and
I
agre
about
the
role
that
he
play
both
in
war
and
in
peac
on
the
economi
and
defeat
fascism
around
the
world
I
would
choos
nelson
mandela
for
hi
generos
of
heart
hi
understand
of
the
need
for
reconcili
but
I
want
to
—
I
want
to
follow
up
on
someth
have
to
do
with
leadership
becaus
you
know
today
senat
sander
said
that
presid
obama
fail
the
presidenti
leadership
test
and
thi
is
not
the
first
time
that
he
ha
critic
presid
obama
In
the
past
he
ha
call
him
weak
He
ha
call
him
a
disappoint
He
wrote
a
forward
for
a
book
that
basic
argu
voter
should
have
buyer
remors
when
it
come
to
presid
obama
leadership
and
legaci
and
I
just
could
not
agre
—
disagre
more
with
those
kind
of
comment
you
know
from
my
perspect
mayb
becaus
I
understand
what
presid
obama
inherit
not
onli
the
worst
financi
crisi
but
the
antipathi
of
the
republican
in
congress
I
do
not
think
he
get
the
credit
he
deserv
for
be
a
president[applause]who
got
us
out
of
that[applause]put
us
on
firm
ground
and
ha
sent
us
into
the
futur
and
it
is
a
—
the
kind
of
critic
that
we
have
heard
from
senat
sander
about
our
presid
I
expect
from
republican
I
do
not
expect
from
someon
run
for
the
democrat
nomin
to
succeed
presid
obama
that
is[applause]madam
secretari
that
is
a
low
blow
I
have
work
with
presid
obama
for
the
last
seven
year
when
presid
obama
came
into
offic
we
were
