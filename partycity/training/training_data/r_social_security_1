Mr
trump
even
conserv
economist
who
have
look
at
your
plan
say
that
the
number
do
not
add
up
that
your
idea
and
you
have
talk
about
25
million
job
creat
4
percent
all
right
the
one
last
area
I
want
to
get
into
with
you
in
thi
debat
is
the
fact
that
the
biggest
driver
of
our
debt
is
entitl
which
is
60
percent
of
all
feder
spend
now
the
committe
for
federal—a
respons
feder
budget
ha
look
at
both
of
your
plan
and
they
say
neither
of
you
ha
a
seriou
plan
that
is
go
to
solv
the
fact
that
medicar
go
to
run
out
of
money
in
the
2020
social
secur
is
go
to
run
out
of
money
in
the
2030
and
at
that
time
recipi
are
go
to
take
huge
cut
in
their
benefit
So
in
effect
the
final
question
I
want
to
ask
you
in
thi
regard
is—and
let
me
start
with
you
Mr
trump
would
presid
trump
make
a
deal
to
save
medicar
and
social
secur
that
includ
both
tax
increas
and
benefit
cut
in
effect
a
grand
bargain
on
entitlements?
by
make
sure
that
we
have
suffici
resourc
and
that
will
come
from
either
rais
the
cap
and/or
find
other
way
to
get
more
money
into
it
I
will
not
cut
benefit
I
want
to
enhanc
benefit
for
low-incom
worker
and
for
women
who
have
been
disadvantag
by
the
current
social
secur
system
but
what
donald
is
propos
with
these
massiv
tax
cut
will
result
in
a
$20
trillion
addit
nation
debt
that
will
have
dire
consequ
for
social
secur
and
medicar
and
I
will
say
someth
about
the
afford
care
act
which
he
want
to
repeal
the
afford
care
act
extend
the
solvenc
of
the
medicar
trust
fund
So
if
repeal
it
our
medicar
problem
get
wors
what
we
need
to
do
is
go
after
