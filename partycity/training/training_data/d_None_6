question
were
who
gave
you
permiss
to
cooperate?
wa
it

If
you
get

would
you
go
to
drop
out?
senat

have
gone
from
say
the
follow
the
american
peopl
are
sick
and
tire
of
hear
about
your
damn
e-
mail
to
claim
that
it
is
a
veri
seriou
issu
which
is
it?
there
is
a
process
under
way
and
that
process
will
take
it
cours
today
in

the
middl
class
is

We

on

of
thi
countri
that
process
specif
tumulty:
secretari
clinton
you
have
known
donald
trump
a
long
time
you
have
seen
what
kind
of
campaign
he
run
secretari
clinton
is
donald
trump
a
racist?
karen
i am
go
to
follow
my
friend
senat
sander
model
here
If
i am
so
fortun
enough
to
be
the
democrat
nomine
there
will
be
a
lot
of
time
to
talk
about
him
I
wa
the
first
one
to
call
him
out
I
call
him
out
when
he
wa
call
mexican
rapist
when
he
wa
engag
in
rhetor
that
I
found
deepli
offens
I
said
basta
and
I
am
pleas
that
others[applause]oth
are
also
join
in
make
clear
that
hi
rhetor
hi
demagogueri
hi
traffick
in
prejudic
and
paranoia
ha
no
place
in
our
polit
system
especi
from
somebodi
run
for
presid
who
could
not
decid
whether
or
not
to
disavow
the
Ku
klux
klan
and
david
duke
So
peopl
can
draw
their
own
conclus
about
him
I
will
just
end
by
say
thi
you
do
not
make
america
great
by
get
rid
of
everyth
that
made
america
great
[applause]
tumulty:
secretari
clinton
my
question
wa
about
hi
charact
and
that
is
one
of
the
primari
thing
that
american
think
about
when
they
choos
their
next
presid
how
would
you
describ
the
charact
of
a
person
who
ha
said
the
sort
of
thing
he
ha
about
mexican
immigr
about
women
and
who
would
ban
peopl
from
enter
thi
countri
base
on
their
religion?
I
think
it
un-american
I
think
what
he
ha
promot
is
not
at
all
in
keep
with
american
valu
karen
and
I
am
go
to
take
everi
opportun
to
critic
him
to
rais
those
issu
i am
not
go
to
engag
in
the
kind
of
languag
that
he
use
I
think
we
can
make
the
case
against
him
if
he
is
the
nomine
by
point
out
what
he
ha
said
what
he
claim
to
believ
in
the
valu
he
promot
and
I
think
that
a
better
way
for
the
american
peopl
to
draw
their
conclus
tumulty:
senat
sander
do
you
think
it
fair
to
call
donald
trump
a
racist?
thi
is
what
I
think
I
think
that
the
american
peopl
are
never
go
to
elect
a
presid
who
insult
mexican
who
insult
muslim
who
insult
women
who
insult
african-american
and
let
us
not
forget
that
sever
year
ago
trump
wa
in
the
middl
of
the
so-
call
birther
movement
tri
to
delegitim
the
presid
of
the
unit
state
of
america
[applause]
you
know
I
find
it
veri

the
major
hispan
organ
in
hi

I
go

becaus
if

been
success
then
a
lot
of
the
issu
we
are
still

today
would
be
in

rear-view
mirror
I
want

to
be
abl
to
achiev
comprehens
immigr
reform
if
i am
so
fortun
enough
to
be
presid
and
we
do
have
to
take
a
look
at
asylum
law
when
I
wa
secretari
of
state
I
work
to
tri
to
support
mani
differ
approach
to
end
the
violenc
in
central
america
I
wa
there
meet
with
leader
secur
leader
and
other
and
I
think
the
congress
should
support
the
presid
request
to
fund
program
that
would
protect
peopl
and
chang
the
cultur
of
crimin
and
violenc
in
central
america
help
peopl
be
abl
to
stay
safe
in
their
home
and
countri
[applause]
let
me
just
answer
I
want
to
get
back
to
thi
2007
immigr
bill
it
true
ted
kennedi
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
I
think
of
the
secretari
did
work
veri
hard
on
that
bill
but
doe
anyon
realli
believ
that
if
that
bill
wa
all
so
good
as
the
secretari
is
tout
that
lulac
and
other
major
latino
organ
the
largest
latino
organ
in
thi
countri
said
no
to
that
bill
and
I
work
veri
hard
in
improv
the
guest
worker
provis
so
that
in
2013
a
bill
I
strongli
support
peopl
who
were
in
the
guest
worker
program
in
america
would
not
be
treat
like
slave
[applause]
let
me
just
conclud
by
say
that
unit
farm
worker
consid
that
bill
in
their
word
the
last
best
hope
for
farm
worker
and
immigr
they
have
proven
to
be
right
in
the
succeed
year
I
onli
hope
that
we
can
put
togeth
a
coalit
to
pass
comprehens
immigr
reform
in
the
next
congress
and
as
I
said

it
a
big
differ
first
of
all
as
I
understand
him
he

about
a
veri
tall
wall
[laughter]
right?
A
beauti
tall
wall
the
most
beauti
tall
wall
better
than
the
great
wall
of
china
that
would
run
the
entir
border
that
he
would
somehow
magic
get
the
mexican
govern
to
pay
for
and
you
know
it
just
fantasi
and
in
fact
if
he
care
to
know
anyth
about
what
member
of
congress
like
the
senat
and
I
have
done
where
it
wa
necessari
we
did
support
some
fenc
where
it
wa
necessari
we
did
add
border
patrol
agent
We
have
done
what
by
ani
fair
estim
would
have
to
conclud
is
a
good
job
quot
"secur
the

in
the
past
you
have
said
that
thi
is
the
result
of
mani
mani
year
of
republican
attack
upon
you
but
american
have
also
had
25
—
more
than
that
—
year
to
get
to
know
you
for
themselv
Is
there
anyth
in
your
own
action
and
the
decis
that
you
yourself
have
made
that
would
foster
thi
kind
of
mistrust?
well
first
karen
obvious
it
pain
for
me
to
hear
that
and
I
do
take
respons
when
you
are
in
public
life
even
if
you
believ
that
it
not
an
opinion
that
you
think
is
fair
or
found
you
do
have
to
take
respons
and
I
do
and
I
also
have
you
know
veri
much
commit
to
the
best
of
my
abil
my
energi
and
effort
to
help
peopl
that
someth
that
I
care
deepli
about
and
I
will
continu
to
do
that
to
demonstr
by
my
past
action
and
my
present
level
of
commit
and
plan
that
peopl
can
count
on
me
that
is
certainli
what
happen
to
me
in
new
york
where
peopl
got
to
know
me
they
saw
me
in
action
and
they
did
look
I
have
said
befor
and
it
will not
surpris
anybodi
to
hear
me
say
it
thi
is
not
easi
for
me
it
not
easi
to
do
what
I
think
is
right
to
help
peopl
to
even
the
odd
to
hear
a
stori
like
the
woman
stori
we
just
heard

to
know
that
I
can
make
a
differ
and
I
want
to
in
everi
way
possibl
I
am
not
a
natur
politician
in
case
you
have
not
notic
like
my
husband
or
presid
obama
So
I
have
a
view
that
I
just
have
to
do
the
best
I
can
get
the
result
I
can
make
a
differ
in
peopl
live
and
hope
that
peopl
see
that
i am
fight
for
them
and
that
I
can
improv
condit
econom
and
other
way
that
will
benefit
them

and
not
just
the
big
bank
all
the
other
financi
interest
that
pose
a
threat
to
our

and
I
have
said
no
bank
is
too
big
to
fail
and
no
execut
is
too
power
to
jail
and
I
will
use
the
power
that
have
now
been
pass
by
the
congress
by
presid
obama
who
incident
took
a
lot
of

chanc
to

some
of

about
thi
issu
It
is
a
realli
seriou
one
and
there
is
not

time
left
to

I

move
quickli
to

you

In

open
wound
among

regard
social

So

nicaragua
cuba
and

senat
in

have
you
ever
regret
the
character
that
you
made
of
daniel
ortega
and
fidel
castro
that
way?
In
retrospect
have
you
ever
regret
the
character
of
daniel
ortega
and
fidel
castro
that
you
made
in
1985?
you
did
not
answer
the
question
secretari
I
have
a
question
on
puerto
rico
puerto
rico
is
bankrupt
It
owe
more
than
$70
billion
it
cannot
pay
and
we
have
a
question
from
facebook
lian
purvea
is
ask
you
the
following;
I
would
like
to
know
if
dure
the
first
100
day
of
your
presid
you
will
help
puerto
rico
restructur
it
public
debt
and
help
it
economi
the
first
100
day
secretari
absolut
although
it
happen
befor
I
am
presid
if
I
am
so
fortun
to
be
I
have
been
call
for
month
that
the
congress
must
give
author
to
puerto
rico
to
restructur
it
debt
[applause]
just
like
it
ha
enabl
state
and
citi
to
restructur
their
debt
and
it
a
grave
injustic
for
the
congress
led
by
the
republican
to
be
refus
to
enact
that
opportun
within
the
bankruptci
law
and
what
we
see
in
puerto
rico
now
is
a
lot
of
suffer
We
see
school
be
close
we
see
health
care
be
deni
and
we
see
a
thousand
puerto
rican
famili
a
month
move
to
the
unit
state
mostli
to
florida
puerto
rican
are
citizen
of
america
[applause]
they
deserv
to
be
treat
as
citizen
and
to
be
given
the
opportun
to
get
back
on
their
feet
econom
and
I
just
want
to
add
one
thing
to
the
question
you
were
ask
senat
sander
I
think
in
that
same
interview
he
prais
what
he
call
the
revolut
of
valu
in
cuba
and
talk
about
how
peopl
were
work
for
the
common
good
not
for
themselv
I
just
could
not
disagre
more
you
know
if
the
valu
are
that
you
oppress
peopl
you
disappear
peopl
you
imprison
peopl
or
even
kill
peopl
for
express
their
opinion
for
express
freedom
of
speech
that
is
not
the
kind
of
revolut
of
valu
that
I
ever
want
to
see
anywher
[applause]
well
as
I
said
earlier
I
do
not
believ
it
is
the
busi
of
the
unit
state
govern
to
be
overthrow
small
countri
around
the
world
and
number
two
when
you
get
to
puerto
rico
there
an
issu
that
we
have
not
talk
about
that
littl
island
is
$73
billion
in
debt
and
the
govern
now
is
pay
interest
rate
of
up
to
11
percent
and
mani
of
the
bond
that
they
are
pay
off
were
purchas
by
vultur
capitalist
for
30
cent
on
the
dollar
and
what
I
have
said
in
talk
to
the
leader
of
puerto
rico
we
have
got
to
bring
peopl
togeth
and
it
not
the
peopl
of
puerto
rico
or
the
children
or
the
school
tumulty:
senat
OK
but
mayb
some
of
these
vultur
capitalist
who
are
go
to
have
to
lose
a
littl
bit
of
money
in
thi
process
tumulty:
We
need
to
move
on
to
anoth
topic
secretari
clinton
there
is
a
vacanc
on
the
suprem
court
at
a
veri
crucial
moment
among
other
thing
the
court
is
consid
the
most
signific
abort
restrict
in
a
gener
So
I
would
like
to
share
with
you
a
question
that
we
got
from
facebook
from
joshua
dansbi
a
law
student
in
washington
DC
who
want
to
know
what
specif
form
of
qualif
you
would
look
for
in
a
suprem
court
justice?
well
I
think
thi
is
one
of
the
most
import
issu
face
our
countri
right
now
and
I
fulli
support
presid
obama
intent
under
the
constitut
to
nomin
a
successor
to
justic
scalia
and
I
believe[applause]i
believ
no
state
probabl
understand
thi
better
than
florida
becaus
let u
rememb
three
words:
bush
versu
gore
[applause]
A
court
took
away
a
presid
now
we
have
got
the
republican
congress
tri
to
take
away
the
constitut
and
we
should
not
toler
that
[applause]
and
so
from
my
perspect
it
is
imper
that
we
put
enorm
pressur
on
the
republican
in
the
senat
to
do
their
constitut
duti
now
obvious
you
look
for
peopl
who
are
not
onli
qualifi
on
paper
but
have
a
heart
have
life
experi
understand
what
these
decis
mean
in
the
live
of
american
and
understand
the
balanc
of
power
that
their
decis
can
disrupt
one
way
or
the
other
So
clearli
I
would
look
for
peopl
who
believ
that
roe
v
wade
is
settl
law
and
that
citizen
unit
need
to
be
overturn
as
quickli
as
possibl
