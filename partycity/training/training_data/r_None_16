As

two
differ
part
of
that
let

start
with
social
medicin
social

It

If

and
social

whether

would
hurt
the

what

If

so
mani
peopl
have
hit

and
other
thing
about
emin

emin

is
an
absolut
necess
for
a

for
our

without

not
have
anyth
you
would
not
have

you
would
not
have

you
need
emin

and
a
lot
of
the
big
conserv
that
tell
me
how
conserv
they
are

oh

the
keyston
pipelin
without

it
would
not
go
10

ok?
you
need
emin
domain
and
emin
domain
is
a
good
thing
not
a
bad
thing
and
what
a

avenu
of

the
first
is

is
known
for
oppos
deal
you
liter
wrote
the
book
on
make
them
senat
cruz
ha
mention
that
on
the
trail
what
would
you
say
to
those
conserv
that
are
concern
that
a
deal
maker
will
just
perpetu
the
same
deal
in
washington
and
the
way
that
thing
run
now
[inaudible]
No
a
good
deal
maker
will
make
great
deal
but
we
will
do
it
the
way
our
founder
thought
it
should
be
done
peopl
get
togeth
they
make
deal
ronald
reagan
did
it
with
tip
oneil
veri
success
you
did
not
hear
so
much
about
execut
order
if
you
heard
about
it
at
all
you
have
to
be
abl
to
get
a
consensu
now
the
real
person
like
it
wa
mention
about
the
deal
with
iran
how
bad
a
deal
is
that?
It
doe
not
get
ani
more
amateurish
than
that
A
good
deal
maker
would
never
make
a
deal
like
that
with
congress
you
have
to
get
everybodi
in
a
room
and
you
have
to
get
them
to
agre
but
you
have
to
get
them
to
agre
what
you
want
and
that
part
of
be
a
deal
maker
you
can not
leav
the
white
hous
go
to
hawaii
and
play
golf
for
three
week
and
be
a
real
deal
maker
It
doe
not
work
that
way
you
have
to
get
peopl
in
grab
them
hug
them
kiss
them
and
get
the
deal
done
but
it
got
to
be
the
deal
that
you
want
[applause]
ham:
governor
kasich
is
the
problem
with
washington
that
there
are
too
mani
deal
or
too
few?
well
right
now
the
deal
—
there
no
leadership
I
mean
a
lot
of
the
thing
that
we
are
talk
about
here
tonight
on
the
border
and
so
mani
of
the
thing
what
we
should
be
do
on
foreign
polici
you
know
what
the
problem
is
mari
katharine?
there
not
a
leader
that
get
somebodi
to
rise
up
you
have
to
have
a
leader
that
can
inspir
and
actual
some
of
what
donald
wa
say
is
true
look
do
you
know
how
hard
it
wa
some?
to
get
the
balanc
the
feder
budget
balanced?
you
have
to
plead
with
peopl
To
do
what
we
have
done
in
ohio
you
have
to
plead
with
peopl
then
you
go
back
down
to
washington
and
do
the
same
thing
you
see
we
have
to
remind
peopl
we
are
american
befor
we
are
republican
and
democrat
and
when
we
wait
and
when
we
delay
what
we
end
up
do
mari
katharin
is
we
make
the
unit
state
weaker
In
fact
it
a
foreign
polici
issu
becaus
peopl
look
at
america
not
solv
problem
and
they
say
what
are
they
do
over
there?
So
the
point
is
you
have
to
work
with
peopl
the
problem
with
execut
author
for
the
presid
it
realli
bad
news
for
thi
reason
sinc
he
given
up
on
work
with
congress
he
think
he
can
impos
anyth
he
want
he
not
a
king
he
a
presid
An
execut
order
should
be
use
frankli
in
consolid
and
with
consult
with
the
leadership
in
the
—
in
the
congress
I
have
done
it
in
ohio
I
consult
I
could
use
execut
order
but
I
do
not
trump
the
legislatur
becaus
if
you
do
you
aggrav
them
you
anger
them
and
then
the
long-term
prospect
get
bleak
We
have
to
solv
problem
in
america
by
come
togeth
republican
and
democrat
american
first
parti
and
ideolog
second
—
in
the
second
back
seat
of
thi
countri
that
what
we
need
to
do
[applause]
and
we
can
do
it
and
we
can

A

It

outrag
and
hillari

say
that
that
acceptable?
becaus
she
is
captiv
of
the

servic
uniform
career
civil

reform
would
allow

that

sheer
incompet
At
a

Dr

happen
[applause]
josh?
mcelveen:
governor
kasich
do
you
have
a
favor
approach?
josh
I
mean
clearli
when
a
veteran
come
home
they
should
get
health
care
anywher
they
want
to
go
In
our
state
which
is
what
we
should
do
in
the
countri
you
know
if
they
drive
a
truck
from
kabul
to
kandahar
in
afghanistan
we
say
you
can
drive
a
truck
from
columbu
to
cleveland
and
you
do
not
have
to
go
get
a
licens
We
are
go
to
hand
you
one
and
if
you
have
got
expertis
in
the
militari
we
are
go
to
give
you
colleg
credit
or
commun
colleg
credit
for
the
thing
that
you
did
for
our
countri
and
in
addit
to
that
I
will
tell
you
one
of
the
biggest
thing
I
think
ha
to
be
done
—
and
I
would
do
it
as
presid
—
the
pentagon
ha
got
to
work
with
the
return
soldier
sailor
along
with
the
famili
and
we
—
they
are
the
most
valuabl
employe
in
the
countri
I
call
them
golden
employe
everybodi
want
to
hire
a
veteran
but
there
is
a
disconnect
between
the
job
open
and
the
veteran
when
the
veteran
come
back
the
veteran
is
a
leader
the
veteran
is
strong
the
veteran
is
drug
free
there
should
be
no
unemploy
among
veteran
and
if
the
pentagon
will
work
with
the
veteran
servic
agenc
all
across
thi
countri
josh
we
can
get
peopl
job
and
we
can
get

quickli
get

them
their

should

for

Mr
trump
thank
you
We
want
to
turn
now
to
social
issu
and
young
voter
and
for
the
question
from
mari
katherin
ham:
thank
you
david
senat
rubio
one
of
the
lazier
piec
of
polit
convent
wisdom
is
that
so-cal
social
issu
are
hurt
republican
with
young
peopl
but
on
the
two
most
promin
social
issu
poll
with
millenni
actual
move
in
differ
direct
On
one
hand
it
is
clear
young
peopl
across
the
polit
spectrum
increasingli
favor
same
sex
marriag
howev
young
voter
have
not
move
to
the
left
on
abort
In
fact
larg
number
of
them
favor
at
least
some
modest
restrict
that
conserv
have
support
how
do
you
speak
to
millenni
on
both
these
issu
while
democrat
will
inevit
charg
intoler
and
extremism?
well
first
of
all
I
do
not
believ
that
believ
in
tradit
marriag
the
way
I
do
make
you
a
bigot
or
a
hater
It
mean
that
you
believ
that
thi
institut
that
been
around
for
milleni
is
an
import
cornerston
of
societi
I
respect
peopl
that
believ
differ
but
I
believ
deepli
that
marriag
should
be
between
one
man
and
one
woman
[applause]
On
the
issu
of
life
to
me
the
issu
of
life
is
not
a
polit
issu
it
a
human
right
issu
and
it
a
difficult
issu
becaus
it
put
in
conflict
two
compet
right
On
the
one
hand
is
the
right
of
a
woman
to
choos
what
to
do
with
her
bodi
which
is
a
real
right
and
on
the
other
hand
is
the
right
of
an
unborn
human
child
to
live
and
they
are
in
conflict
and
as
a
polici
maker
I
must
choos
which
one
of
these
two
side
take
preced
and
I
have
chosen
to
err
on
the
side
of
life
here
what
I
find
outrag
there
ha
been
five
democrat
debat
the
media
ha
not
ask
them
a
singl
question
on
abort
and
on
abort
the
democrat
are
extremist
whi
doe
not
the
media
ask
hillari
clinton
whi
she
believ
that
all
abort
should
be
legal
even
on
the
due
date
of
that
unborn
child
whi
do
not
they
ask
hillari
clinton
whi
she
believ
that
partial-
birth
abort
which
is
a
gruesom
procedur
that
ha
been
outlaw
in
thi
countri
she
think
that
a
fundament
right
they
are
the
extremists[bel
rings]when
it
come
to
the
issu
of
abort
and
I
can not
wait
to
expos
them
in
a
gener
elect
[applause]
ham:
governor
bush?
I
want
to
come
to
you
your
alli
have
recent
attack
senat
rubio
for
be
too
pro-lif
to
be
elect
in
novemb
you
made
a
similar
charg
state
it
in
an
interview
thi
is
a
pro-lif
parti
Do
you
stand
behind
that
criticism?
bush:
look
i am
pro-lif
In
fact
on
thi
stage
i am
the
most
pro-lif
person
becaus
I
have
act
on
it
for
eight
year
as
governor
of
the
state
of
florida
[applause]
where
we
abolish
partial-birth
abort
where
parent
have
the
right
to
be
notifi
when
their
teenag
child
is
have
an
abort
We
were
the
first
state
to
do
a
choos
life
licens
plate
to
rais
money
for
adopt
We
were
the
first
state
to
have
state
moni
go
to
crisi
pregnanc
center
which
recent
wa
just
increas
to
$4
million
a
year
We
creat
greater
regul
on
abort
clinic
where
there
were
horrif
procedur
So
i am
pro
life
but
I
believ
there
should
be
exceptions:
rape
incest
and
when
the
life
of
the
mother
is
in
danger
and
so
that
belief
and
my
consist
on
thi
make
me
I
think
pois
to
be
in
the
right
place
the
sweet
spot
for
a
republican
nomine
and
other
may
have
a
differ
view
and
I
respect
it
[applause]
bush:
but
I
think
we
have
to
be
cogniz
of
the
fact
there
a
lot
of
peopl
that

about
have
a
pro-lif
