the

it
the
time
constraint
you
and
governor
christi
have
been
exchang
some
fairli
nasti
word
of
late
and
I
will
allow
the
governor
to
respond
as
well
the
governor
went
so
far
to
say
you
will not
be
abl
to
slime
your
way
to
the
white
hous
he
refer
to
a
seri
of
ad
done
by
a

speak
on
your

that
say
quote"on
high
tax
common
core
liber
energy-lov
obamacar
medicaid-expand
presid
is
enough
you
think
you
went
too
far
on
that
and
do
you
want
to
apolog
to
the
governor?
that
is
not
my
question
Is
he
a
liberal?
Is
he
a
liberal?
governor?
[applause]
christie:
I
stood
on
the
stage
and
watch
marco
in
rather
indignantli
look
at
governor
bush
and
say
someon
told
you
that
becaus
we
are
run
for
the
same
offic
that
critic
me
will
get
you
to
that
offic
It
appear
that
the
same
someon
who
ha
been
whisper
in
old
marco
ear
too
[laughter]
So
the
indign
that
you
carri
on
some
of
the
stuff
you
have
to
also
own
then
So
let u
set
the
fact
straight
first
of
all
I
did
not
support
sonia
sotomayor
secondli
I
never
wrote
a
check
to
plan
parenthood
third
if
you
look
at
my
record
as
governor
of
new
jersey
I
have
veto
a
50-calib
rifl
ban
I
have
veto
a
reduct
thi
clip
size
I
veto
a
statewid
ID
system
for
gun
owner
and
I
pardon
six
out-of-st
folk
who
came
through
our
state
and
were
arrest
for
own
a
gun
legal
in
anoth
state
so
they
never
have
to
face
charg
and
on
common
core
common
core
ha
been
elimin
in
new
jersey
So
listen
thi
is
the
differ
between
be
a
governor
and
a
senat
see
when
you
are
a
senat
what
you
get
to
do
is
just
talk
and
talk
and
talk
and
you
talk
so
much
that
nobodi
can
ever
keep
up
with
what
you
are
say
is
accur
or
not
when
you
are
a
governor
you
are
held
account
for
everyth
you
do
and
the
peopl
of
new
jersey
I
have
seen
it
[applause]
christie:
and
the
last
piec
is
thi
I
like
marco
too
and
two
year
ago
he
call
me
a
conserv
reform
that
new
jersey
need
that
wa
befor
he
wa
run
against
me
now
that
he
is
he
chang
hi
tune
i am
never
go
to
chang
my
tune
I
like
marco
rubio
he
a
good
guy
a
smart
guy
and
he
would
be
a
heck
of
a
lot
better
presid
than
hillari
rodham
clinton
would
ever
be
[applause]
bush:
neil
my
name
wa
mention
here
neil
my
name
wa
mention
as
well
here
the
deal
chri
is
total
right
he
been
a
good
governor
and
he
a
heck
of
a
lot
better
than
hi
predecessor
that
would
have
bankrupt
new
jersey
everybodi
on
thi
stage
is
better
than
hillari
clinton
and
I
think
the
focu
ought
to
be
on
make
sure
that
we
leav
thi
nomin
process
as
wild
and
woolli
as
it
go
to
be
—
thi
is
not
be
bad
these
attack
ad
are
go
to
be
part
of
life
everybodi
just
need
to
get
use
to
it
everybodi
record
go
to
be
scrutin
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
need
to
unit
behind
the
winner
so
we
can
defeat
hillari
clinton
becaus
she
is
a
disast
[applause]
our
countri
rise
up
again
but
we
need
to
have
a
compel
conserv
agenda
that
we
present
to
the
american
peopl
in
a
way
that
doe
not
disparag
peopl
that
unit
us
around
our
common
purpos
and
so
everybodi
need
to
discount
some
of
the
thing
you
are
go
to
hear
in
these
ad
and
discount
the
—
the
back-and-forth
here
becaus
everi
person
here
is
better
than
hillari
clinton
you
were?
governor
kasich[applause]
governor
kasich
hillari
clinton
is
get
some
seriou
competit
from

hi
prais
say
berni
is
speak
to
a
yearn
that
is
deep
and
real
and

So
what
doe
it
say
about
our
countri
that
a
candid
who
is
a
self-avow
socialist
and
who
doe
not
think
a
90
percent
tax
rate
is
too
high
could
be
the
democrat
nominee?
Dr
carson
one
of
the
other
candid
on
thi
stage
ha
brought
bill
clinton
past
indiscret
Is
that
a
legitim
topic
in
thi
election?
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
notion
that
hillari
clinton
is
an
enabl
of
sexual
misconduct?
thank
you
sir
Mr

those
countri
in
asia
are
interfac
against
china
and
we
do
need
china
—
donald
right
about
north
korea
I
mean
the
fact
is
is
that
they
need
to
put
the
pressur
on
and
frankli
we
need
to
intercept
ship
come
out
of
north
korea
so
they
do
not
prolifer
all
these
danger
materi
but
what
he
touch
—
talk
about
I
think
ha
got
merit
and
I
will
allow
put
that
tariff
or
whatev
he
say
here
i am
happi
to
have
him
tonight[laughter]
all
right
but
on
thi
point
if
I
may
add
someth
on
thi
point
We
are
all
frustrat
with
what
china
is
do
I
think
we
need
to
be
veri
care
with
tariff
and
here
whi
china
doe
not
pay
the
tariff
the
buyer
pay
the
tariff
If
you
send
a
tie
or
a
shirt
made
in
china
into
the
unit
state
and
an
american
goe
to
buy
it
at
the
store
and
there
a
tariff
on
it
it
get
pass
on
in
the
price
to
price
to
the
consum
So
I
think
the
better
approach
the
best
thing
we
can
do
to
protect
ourselv
against
china
econom
is
to
make
our
economi
stronger
which
mean
revers
cours
from
all
the
damag
barack
obama
is
do
to
thi
economi
It
begin
with
tax
reform
let
not
have
the
most
expens
busi
tax
rate
in
the
world
let
allow
compani
to
immedi
expens
[applause]
It
continu
with
regulatori
reform
regul
in
thi
countri
are
out
of
control
especi
the
employ
prevent
agenc
the
epa
and
all
of
the
rule
they
continu
to
impos
on
our
economi
and
hurt
us
how
about
obamacar
a
certifi
job
killer?
It
need
to
be
repeal
and
replac
and
we
need
to
bring
our
debt
under
control
make
our
economi
stronger
that
is
the
way
to
deal
with
china
at
the
end
of
the
day
We
are
get
He
is

senat

[applause]
and
then
we
have
to
get
to
tax
reform
and
we
do
not
need
a
weak
person
be
presid
of
the
unit
state
ok?
becaus
that
what
wed
get
if
it
were
jeb
—
I
tell
you
what
we
do
not
need
that
audience:
boo
We
do
not
need
that
that
essenti
what
we
have
now
and
we
do
not
need
that
and
that
whi
we
are
in
the
troubl
that
we
are
in
now
and
by
the
way
jeb
you
mention
boe
take
a
look
they
order
plane
they
make
boe
build
their
plant
in
china
they
do
not
want
them
made
here
they
want
those
plane
made
in
china
bush:
they
are
a
mile
away
from
here
thank
you
governor
bush
thank
you
Mr

veri
briefli
bush:
My
name
wa
mention
My
name
wa
mention
here
the
simpl
fact
is
that
the
plane
that
be
build
here
is
be
sold
to
china
you
can
—
if
you
—
you
flew
in
with
your
767
did
not
you?
right
there
right
next
to
the
plant
thank
you
Mr
trmup
thank
you
governor
senat
briefli
thank
for
come
back
to
me
maria
both
donald
and
jeb
have
good
point
and
there
is
a
middl
ground
donald
is
right
that
china
is
run
over
presid
obama
like
he
is
a
child
presid
obama
is
not
protect
american
worker
and
we
are
get
hammer
you
know
I
sat
down
with
the
senior
leadership
of
john
deer
they
discuss
how
—
how
hard
it
is
to
sell
tractor
in
china
becaus
all
the
regulatori
barrier
they
are
protectionist
but
jeb
is
also
right
that
if
we
just
impos
a
tariff
they
will
put
reciproc
tariff
which
will
hurt
iowa
farmer
and
south
carolina
produc
and
20
percent
of
the
american
job
that
depend
on
export
So
the
way
you
do
it
is
you
pass
a
tax
plan
like
the
tax
plan
I
have
introduced:
a
simpl
flat
tax
10
percent
for
individu
and
a
16
percent
busi
flat
tax
you
abolish
the
irs[applause]and
here
the
critic
point
maria
—
the
busi
flat
tax
enabl
us
to
abolish
the
corpor
incom
tax
the
death
tax
the
obamacar
tax
the
payrol
tax
and
they
are
border-adjust
so
everi
export
pay
no
tax
whatsoev
it
tax-fre
—
a
huge
advantag
for
our
farmer
and
rancher
and
manufactur
—
and
everi
import
pay
the
16
percent
busi
flat
tax
it
like
a
tariff
but
here
the
difference:
if
we
impos
a
tariff
china
respond
the
busi
flat
tax
they
alreadi
impos
their
tax
on
us
so
there
no
reciprocal[bel
rings]tariff
that
come
against
us
It
put
us
on
a
level
even
play
field
which
bring
job
here
at
home
unknown:

It
is
also
the
case
that
that

one
of
the
thing
it
did
is
it
expand
barack
obama
power

It
enabl
him
—
the
presid
to
certifi

a
mistak
that
whi
I
have

lead
the

would
note
the

I
vote
ye
