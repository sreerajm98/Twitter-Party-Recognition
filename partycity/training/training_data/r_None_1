I
find
that
just
absolutely[crosstalk]
Mr
trump
Mr
trump[crosstalk]
I
do
get
to
ask
some
question
and
I
would
like
to
ask
you
thi
direct
question
the
top
nation
secur
offici
of
thi
countri
do
believ
that
russia
ha
been
behind
these
hack
even
if
you
do
not
know
for

whether
they
are
do
you
condemn
ani
interfer
by
russia
in
the
american

you
condemn
their
interference?
i am
not
asking—im
ask
do
you
condemn?
We
are
a
long
way
away
from
immigr
but
i am
go
to
let
you
finish
thi
topic
you
got
about
45
second
i—i
find
it
iron
that
he
rais
nuclear
weapon
thi
is
a
person
who
ha
been
veri
cavali
even
casual
about
the
use
of
nuclear
weapon
he
advoc
more
countri
get
them
japan
korea
even
saudi
arabia
He
said
well
if
we
have
them
whi
do
not
we
use
them
which
I
think
is
terrifi
but
here
the
deal
the
bottom
line
on
nuclear
weapon
is
that
when
the
presid
give
the
order
it
must
be
follow
there
about
four
minut
between
the
order
be
given
and
the
peopl
respons
for
launch
nuclear
weapon
to
do
so
and
that
whi
10
peopl
who
have
had
that
awesom
respons
have
come
out
and
in
an
unpreced
way
said
they
would
not
trust
donald

with
the
nuclear
code
or
to
have

finger
on

button

He

about
that

So

30

what
I
have
done
for

tri
to

I
could

get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
with
your
30
year
and
I
will
let
the
american
peopl
make
that
decis
all
right
We
are
go
to
get
to
foreign
hot
spot
in
a
few
moment
but
the
next
segment
is
fit
to
be
presid
of
the
unit
state
Mr
trump
at
the
last
debat
you
said
your
talk
about
grab
women
wa
just
that
talk
and
that
youd
never
actual
done
it
and
sinc
then
as
we
all
know
nine
women
have
come
forward
and
have
said
that
you
either
grope
them
or
kiss
them
without
their
consent
whi
would
so
mani
differ
women
from
so

differ

whi
would
they
all
in

last
coupl
of
week
make
up—you
deni
this—whi
would
they
all
make
up
these
stories?
sinc
thi
is
a
question
for
both
of
you
secretari
clinton
Mr
trump
say
what
your
husband
did
and
that
you
defend
wa
even
wors
Mr
trump
you
go
first
At
the
last
debat
we
heard
donald
talk
about
what
he
did
to
women
and
after
that
a
number
of
women
have
come
forward
say
that
exactli
what
he
did
to
them
now
what
wa
hi
response?
well
he
held
a
number
of
big
ralli
where
he
said
that
he
could
not
possibl
have
done
those
thing
to
those
women
becaus
they
were
not
attract
enough
for
them
to
be
assault
her
two
minutes—sir
her
two
minut
her
two
minut
Mr
trump
pleas
everybodi
well
everi
time
donald
is
push
on
someth
which
is
obvious
uncomfort
like
what
these
women
are
say
he
immedi
goe
to
deni
respons
and
it
not
just
about
women
He
never
apolog
or
say
he
sorri
for
anyth
So
we
know
what
he
ha
said
and
what
he
done
to
women
but
he
also
went
after
a
disabl
report
mock
and
mimick
him
on
nation
televis
He
went
after
Mr

mr
khan
the
parent
of
a
young
man
who
die
serv
our
countri
a
gold
star
famili
becaus
of
their
religion
He
went
after
john
mccain
a
prison
of

said
he
prefer
"peopl

are
not
captured"
He
went
after
a

donald
said

not
be
trust
to
tri
the
fraud

univers
becaus

So
it
not

thing
thi
is
a
pattern
a

of

more

commit
to
that
principle?
well
chri
let
me
respond
to
that
becaus
that
horrifi
you
know
everi
time
donald
think
thing
are
not
go
in
hi
direct
he
claim
whatev
it
is
is
rig
against
him
the
fbi
conduct
a
year-long
investig
into
my
e-mail
they
conclud
there
wa
no
case;
he
said
the
fbi
wa
rig
He
lost
the
iowa
caucu
He
lost
the
wisconsin
primari
He
said
the
republican
primari
wa
rig
against
him
then
trump
univers
get
su
for
fraud
and
racketeering;
he
claim
the
court
system
and
the
feder
judg
is
rig
against
him
there
wa
even
a
time
when
he
did
not
get
an
emmi
for
hi
TV
program
three
year
in
a
row
and
he
start
tweet
that
the
emmi
were
rig
against
him
it
just
show
you
are
not
up
to
do
the
job
and
lets—you
know
let u
be
clear
about
what
he
is
say
and
what
that
mean
He
is
denigrating—h
talk
down
our
democraci
and
I
for
one
am
appal
that
somebodi
who
is
the
nomine
of
one
of
our
two
major
parti
would
take
that
kind
of
posit
all
right
Mr
trump
same
question
If
we
are
abl
to
push
isi
out
of
mosul
and
out
of
iraq
will—would
you
be
will
to
put
US
troop
in
there
to
prevent
their
return
or
someth
else?
sir
your
two
minut
are
up
well
you
know
onc
again
donald
is
impli
that
he
did
not
support
the
invas
of
iraq
I
said
it
wa
a
mistak
I
have
said
that
year
ago
He
ha
consist
deni
what
is
a
veri
clear
fact
that
befor
the
invas
he
support
it
and
you
know
I
just
want
everybodi
to
go
googl
it
googl
"donald
trump
iraq"
and
you
will
see
the
dozen
of
sourc
which
verifi
that
he
wa
for
the
invas
of
iraq
and
you
can
actual
hear
the
audio
of
him
say
that
now
whi
doe
that
matter?
well
it
matter
becaus
he
ha
not
told
the
truth
about
that
posit
I
guess
he
believ
it
make
him
look
better
now
to
contrast
with
me
becaus
I
did
vote
for
it
but
what
realli
import
here
is
to
understand
all
the
interplay
mosul
is
a
sunni
citi
mosul
is
on
the
border
of
syria
and
ye
we
do
need
to
go
after
baghdadi
and—just
like
we
went
after
bin
laden
while
you
were
do
"celebr
apprentice"
and
we
brought
him
to
justic
We
need
to
go
after
the
leadership
but
we
need
to
get
rid
of
them
get
rid
of
their
fighter
there
are
an
estim
sever
thousand
fighter
in
mosul
they
have
been
dig
underground
they
have
been
prepar
to
defend
it
go
to
be
tough
fight
but
I
think
we
can
take
back
mosul
and
then
we
can
move
on
into
syria
and
take
back
raqqa
thi
is
what
we
have
to
do
i am
just
amaz
that
he
seem
to
think
that
the
iraqi
govern
and
our
alli
and
everybodi
els
launch
the
attack
on
mosul
to
help
me
in
thi
elect
but
that
how
donald
think
you
know
he
alway
is
look
for
some
conspiraci
He
ha
all
the
conspiraci
theories[crosstalk]
secretari

its[crosstalk]
thi
conspiraci
theori
which
he
been
spew
out
for
quit

time
He
says[crosstalk]
unfit
and
he
prove
it
everi
time
he
talk
well
you
should
ask
berni
sander
who
he
support
for

and
he
ha
said
let
turn

Mr

last
debat
you

ask
about
the
situat
in
the
syrian
citi
of
aleppo
and
I
want
to
follow
up
on
that
becaus
you
said
sever
thing
in
that
debat
which
were
not
true
sir
you
said
that
aleppo
ha
basic
fallen
In
fact
there—in
fact
there
are
it
a
catastroph
but
there
there
are
a
quarter
of
sir
sir
if
I
may
finish
my
question
well
there
are
a
quarter
of
a
million
peopl
still
live
there
and
be
slaughter
ye
If
I
may
just
finish
here
and
you
also
said
that—that
syria
and
russia
are
busi
fight
isi
In
fact
they
have
been
the
one
who
have
been
bomb
and
shell
eastern
aleppo
and
they
just
announc
a
humanitarian
paus
in
effect
admit
that
they
have
been
bomb
and
shell
aleppo
would
you
like
to
clear
that
up
sir?
let
me
folk
I
want
to
get
into
our
final
segment
real
quick
OK
Mr
trump
secretari
clinton—no
we
need
to
move
on
to
our
final
segment
and
that
is
the
nation
debt
which
ha
not
been
discuss
until
tonight
our
nation
debt
as
a
share
of
the
economi
our
gdp
is
now
77
percent
that
the
highest
sinc
just
after
world
war
II
but
the
nonpartisan
committe
for
a
respons
feder
budget
say
secretari
clinton
under
your
plan
debt
would
rise
to
86
percent
of
gdp
over
the
next
10
year
Mr
trump
under
your
plan
they
say
it
would
rise
to
105
percent
of
gdp
over
the
next
10
year
the
question
is
whi
are
both
of
you
ignor
thi
problem?
Mr
trump
you
go
first
well
first
when
I
hear
donald
talk
like
that
and
know
that
hi
slogan
is
"make
america
great
again"
I
wonder
when
he
thought
america
wa
great
and
befor
he
rush
and
say
"you
know
befor
you
and
presid
obama
were
there"
I
think
it
import
to
recogn
that
he
ha
been
critic
our
govern
for
decad
you
know
back
in
1987
he
took
out
a
$100000
ad
in
the
new
york
time
dure
the
time
when
presid
reagan
wa
presid
and
basic
said
exactli
what
he
just
said
now
that
we
were
the
laughingstock
of
the
world
He
wa
critic
presid
reagan
thi
is
the
way
donald
think
about
himself
put
himself
into
you
know
the
middl
and
say
"you
know
I
alon
can
fix
it"
as
he
said
on
the
convent
stage
but
if
you
look
at
the
debt
which
is
the
issu
you
ask
about
chri
I
pay
for
everyth
i am
propos
I
do
not
add
a
penni
to
the
nation
debt
I
take
that
veri
serious
becaus
I
do
think
it
one
of
the
issu
we
have
got
to
come
to
grip
with
So
when
I
talk
about
how
we
are
go
to
pay
for
educ
how
we
are
go
to
invest
in
infrastructur
how
we
are
go
to
get
the
cost
of
prescript
drug
down
and
a
lot
of
the
other
issu
that
peopl
talk
to
me
about
all
the
time
I
have
made
it
veri
clear
we
are
go
where
the
money
is
We
are
go
to
ask
the
wealthi
and
corpor
to
pay
their
fair
share
and
there
is
no
evid
whatsoev
that
that
will
slow
down
or
diminish
our
growth
In
fact
I
think
just
the
opposit
We
will
have
what
economist
call
middle-out
growth
We
have
got
to
get
back
to
rebuild
the
middl
class
the
famili
of
america
that
where
growth
will
come
from
that
whi
I
want
to
invest
in
you
I
want
to
invest
in
your
famili
and
I
think
that
the
smartest
way
to
grow
the
economi
to
make
the
economi
fairer
and
we
just
have
a
big
disagr
about
thi
It
may
be
becaus
of
our
experi
you
know
he
start
off
with
hi
dad
as
a
millionair
I
start
off
with—mi
dad
wa
a
small-busi
man
time
well
no
sir
becaus
we
are
run
out
of
time
OK
that
not
go
to
help
in
the
entitl
well
chri
I
am
on
record
as
say
that
we
need
to
put
more
money
into
the
social
secur
trust
fund
that
part
of
my
commit
to
rais
tax
on
the
wealthi
My
social
secur
payrol
contribut
will
go
up
as
will
donald
assum
he
can not
figur
out
how
to
get
out
of
it
but
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
replenish
the
social
secur
trust
fund
secretari
clinton
thank
you
Mr
trump?
