secretari
clinton
thank
you
Mr
trump
the
same
question
to
you
it
about
put
money—mor
money
into
the
pocket
of
american
worker
you
have
up
to
two
minut
let
me
follow
up
with
Mr
trump
if
you
can
you
have
talk
about
creat
25
million
job
and
you
have
promis
to
bring
back
million
of
job
for
american
how
are
you
go
to
bring
back
the
industri
that
have
left
thi
countri
for
cheaper
labor
overseas?
how
specif
are
you
go
to
tell
american
manufactur
that
you
have
to
come
back?
let
me
interrupt
just
a
moment
but
back
to
the
question
though
how
do
you
bring
back—specif
bring
back
job
american
manufacturers?
how
do
you
make
them
bring
the
job
back?
well
let u
stop
for
a
second
and
rememb
where
we
were
eight
year
ago
We
had
the
worst
financi
crisi
the
great
recess
the
worst
sinc
the
1930
that
wa
in
larg
part
becaus
of
tax
polici
that
slash
tax
on
the
wealthi
fail
to
invest
in
the
middl
class
took
their
eye
off
of
wall
street
and
creat
a
perfect
storm
In
fact
donald
wa
one
of
the
peopl
who
root
for
the
hous
crisi
He
said
back
in
2006
"gee
I
hope
it
doe
collaps
becaus
then
I
can
go
in
and
buy
some
and
make
some
money"
well
it
did
collaps
nine
million
people—nin
million
peopl
lost
their
job
five
million
peopl
lost
their
home
and
$13
trillion
in
famili
wealth
wa
wipe
out
now
we
have
come
back
from
that
abyss
and
it
ha
not
been
easi
So
we
are
now
on
the
precipic
of
have
a
potenti
much
better
economi
but
the
last
thing
we
need
to
do
is
to
go
back
to
the
polici
that
fail
us
in
the
first
place
independ
expert
have
look
at
what
I
have
propos
and
look
at
what
donald
propos
and
basic
they
have
said
thi
that
if
hi
tax
plan
which
would
blow
up
the
debt
by
over
$5
trillion
and
would
in
some
instanc
disadvantag
middle-class
famili
compar
to
the
wealthi
were
to
go
into
effect
we
would
lose
35
million
job
and
mayb
have
anoth
recess
they
have
look
at
my
plan
and
they
have
said
OK
if
we
can
do
thi
and
I
intend
to
get
it
done
we
will
have
10
million
more
new
job
becaus
we
will
be
make
invest
where
we
can
grow
the
economi
take
clean
energi
some
countri
is
go
to
be
the
clean-
energi
superpow
of
the
21st
centuri
donald
think
that
climat
chang
is
a
hoax
perpetr
by
the
chines
I
think
it
real
I
think
scienc
is
real
Mr
trump?
well
actual
well
actual
I
have
thought
about
thi
quit
a
bit
and
I
have—wel
not
quit
that
long
I
think
my
husband
did
a
pretti
good
job
in
the
1990
I
think
a
lot
about
what
work
and
how
we
can
make
it
work
again
million
new
job
a
balanc
budget
veri
quickli
well
I
have
been
a
senat
donald
and
I
have
been
a
secretari
of
state
and
I
have
done
a
lot
well
that
your
opinion
that
is
your
opinion
well
that
is
just
not
accur
I
wa
against
it
onc
it
wa
final
negoti
and
the
term
were
laid
out
I
wrote
about
that
in
you
call
it
the
gold
standard
[crosstalk]
No
well
donald
I
know
you
live
in
your
own
realiti
but
that
is
not
the
fact
the
fact
are—i
did
say
I
hope
it
would
be
a
good
deal
but
when
it
wa
negoti
which
I
wa
not
respons
for
I
conclud
it
wa
not
I
wrote
about
that
in
my
book
befor
you
even
announc
look
there
are
differ
there
are
there
are
differ
view
about
what
good
for
our
countri
our
economi
and
our
leadership
in
the
world
and
I
think
it
import
to
look
at
what
we
need
to
do
to
get
the
economi
go
again
that
whi
I
said
new
job
with
rise
incom
invest
not
in
more
tax
cut
that
would
add
$5
trillion
to
the
debt
but
in—oh
but
I
do
In
fact
I
have
written
a
book
about
it
it
call
"stronger
together"
you
can
pick
it
up
tomorrow
at
a
bookstor
but
it
becaus
I
see
this—w
need
to
have
strong
growth
fair
growth
sustain
growth
We
also
have
to
look
at
how
we
help
famili
balanc
the
respons
at
home
and
the
respons
at
busi
So
we
have
a
veri
robust
set
of
plan
and
peopl
have
look
at
both
of
our
plan
have
conclud
that
mine
would
creat
10
million
job
and
your
would
lose
us
35
million
job
and
explod
the
debt
which
would
have
a
recess
I
kind
of
assum
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
these
charg
and
claim
and
so
So
we
have
taken
the
home
page
of
my
websit
hillaryclintoncom
and
we
have
turn
it
into
a
fact-check
So
if
you
want
to
see
in
real-tim
what
the
fact
are
pleas
go
and
take
a
look
becaus
what
I
have
propos
well
you
just
open
the
next
segment
i am
go
to
give
you
a
chanc
right
here
with
a
new
15-minut
segment
Mr
trump
i am
go
to
achiev
prosper
No
we
are
not
No
we
are
not
OK
you
are
unpack
a
lot
here
and
we
are
still
on
the
issu
of
achiev
prosper
and
I
want
to
talk
about
tax
the
fundament
differ
between
the
two
of
you
concern
the
wealthi
secretari
clinton
you
are
call
for
a
tax
increas
on
the
wealthiest
american
Id
like
you
to
further
defend
that
and
Mr
trump
you
are
call
for
tax
cut
for
the
wealthi
Id
like
you
to
defend
that
and
thi
next
two-minut
answer
goe
to
you
Mr
trump
I
have
a
feel
that
by
the
end
of
thi
even
i am
go
to
be
blame
for
everyth
that
ever
happen
whi
not?
yeah
whi
not?
[laughter]
you
know
just
join
the
debat
by
say
more
crazi
thing
now
let
me
say
thi
it
is
absolut
the
case
thi
is—thi
is
secretari
clinton
two
minut
pleas
$4
billion
tax
benefit
for
your
famili
and
when
you
look
at
what
you
are
propos
it
is
Mr
trump
we
are
Mr
trump
we
are
talk
about
the
burden
that
american
have
to
pay
yet
you
have
not
releas
your
tax
return
and
the
reason
nomine
have
releas
their
return
for
decad
is
so
that
voter
will
know
if
their
potenti
presid
owe
money
to—who
he
owe
it
to
and
ani
busi
conflict
Do
not
american
have
a
right
to
know
if
there
are
ani
conflict
of
interest?
the
ir
say
an
audit
of
your
taxes—y
are
perfectli
free
to
releas
your
tax
dure
an
audit
and
so
the
question
doe
the
public
right
to
know
outweigh
your
person
So
it
negotiable?
well
I
think
you
have
seen
anoth
exampl
of
bait-and-
switch
here
for
40
year
everyon
run
for
presid
ha
releas
their
tax
return
you
can
go
and
see
nearli
I
think
39
40
year
of
our
tax
return
but
everyon
ha
done
it
We
know
the
ir
ha
made
clear
there
is
no
prohibit
on
releas
it
when
you
are
under
audit
So
you
have
got
to
ask
yourself
whi
will not
he
releas
hi
tax
returns?
and
I
think
there
may
be
a
coupl
of
reason
first
mayb
he
not
as
rich
as
he
say
he
is
second
mayb
he
not
as
charit
as
he
claim
to
be
third
we
do
not
know
all
of
hi
busi
deal
but
we
have
been
told
through
investig
report
that
he
owe
about
$650
million
to
wall
street
and
foreign
bank
Or
mayb
he
doe
not
want
the
american
peopl
all
of
you
watch
tonight
to
know
that
he
paid
noth
in
feder
tax
becaus
the
onli
year
that
anybodi
ever
seen
were
a
coupl
of
year
when
he
had
to
turn
them
over
to
state
author
when
he
wa
tri
to
get
a
casino
licens
and
they
show
he
did
not
pay
ani
feder
incom
tax
I
do
you
know
I
made
a
mistak
use
a
privat
e-
mail
Mr
trump?
and
mayb
becaus
you
have
not
paid
ani
feder
incom
tax
for
a
lot
of
year
[applause]
and
the
other
thing
I
think
is
import
is
if
your—if
your
main
claim
to
be
presid
of
the
unit
state
is
your
busi
then
I
think
we
should
talk
about
that
you
know
your
campaign
manag
said
that
you
built
a
lot
of
busi
on
the
back
of
littl
guy
and
inde
I
have
met
a
lot
of
the
peopl
who
were

and
your

donald
I
have
met

wa
who
you
refus

that
you
ask
them
to

We

It

and
you
would
not

what
the
man
need
to
be
paid
what
he
wa
charg
you
to
do
well
to
Do
the
thousand
of
peopl
that
you
have
stif
over
the
cours
of

not

some

of

say
that
i am
certainli
reliev
that
my
late
father
never
did
busi
with
you
He
provid
a
good
middle-class
life
for
us
but
the
peopl
he
work
for
he
expect
the
bargain
to
be
kept
on
both
side
and
when
we
talk
about
your
busi
you
have
taken
busi
bankruptci
six
time
there
are
a
lot
of
great
businesspeopl
that

onc
you
call
yourself
the
king
of

even
at
one
time
suggest
that
you
would
tri
to

down

need
to
be
veri
clear

ani
differ
than
mr
clinton
judgment?
secretari
clinton?
whew
OK
[laughter]
let
talk
about
two
import
issu
that
were
briefli
mention
by
donald
first
nato
you
know
nato
as
a
militari
allianc
ha
someth
call
articl
5
and
basic
it
say
this:
An
attack
on
one
is
an
attack
on
all
and
you
know
the
onli
time
it
ever
been
invoked?
after
9/11
when
the
28
nation
of
nato
said
that
they
would
go
to
afghanistan
with
us
to
fight
terror
someth
that
they
still
are
do
by
our
side
with
respect
to
iran
when
I
becam
secretari
of
state
iran
wa
week
away
from
have
enough
nuclear
materi
to
form
a
bomb
they
had
master
the
nuclear
fuel
cycl
under
the
bush
administr
they
had
built
covert
facil
they
had
stock
them
with
centrifug
that
were
whirl
away
and
we
had
sanction
them
I
vote
for
everi
sanction
against
iran
when
I
wa
in
the
senat
but
it
wa
not
enough
So
I
spent
a
year-and-a-half
put
togeth
a
coalit
that
includ
russia
and
china
to
impos
the
toughest
sanction
on
iran
and
we
did
drive
them
to
the
negoti
tabl
and
my
successor
john
kerri
and
presid
obama
got
a
deal
that
put
a
lid
on
iran
nuclear
program
without
fire
a
singl
shot
that
diplomaci
that
coalition-build
that
work
with
other
nation
the
other
day
I
saw
donald
say
that
there
were
some
iranian
sailor
on
a
ship
in
the
water
off
of
iran
and
they
were
taunt
american
sailor
who
were
on
a
nearbi
ship
He
said
you
know
if
they
taunt
our
sailor
Id
blow
them
out
of
the
water
and
start
anoth
war
that
not
good
judgment
that
is
not
the
right
tempera
to
be
commander-in-
chief
to
be
taunt
and
the
worst
part
have
a
good
time
folk
and
in
fact
hi
cavali
attitud
about
nuclear
weapon
is
so
deepli
troubl
that
is
the
number-on
threat
we
face
in
the
world
and
it
becom
particularli
threaten
if
terrorist
ever
get
their
hand
on
ani
nuclear
materi
So
a
man
who
can
be
provok
by
a
tweet
should
not
have
hi
finger
anywher
near
the
nuclear
code
as
far
as
I
think
anyon
with
ani
sens
about
thi
should
be
concern
it
a
good
one
though
It
well
describ
the
problem
[laughter]
We
need
to
move
on
our
last
which
lead
to
my
next
question
as
we
enter
our
last
segment
here
on
the
still
on
the
subject
of
secur
america
On
nuclear
weapon
presid
obama
reportedli
