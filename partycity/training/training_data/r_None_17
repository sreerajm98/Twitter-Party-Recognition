the
alli
of

what

will
wind
up
with
is
a
larger
and
more

isi
that
occupi
that

[crosstalk]
paul:
yeah
no
I
think
that
a
—
that
a
huge
mistak
to
be
close
down
mosqu
but
I
would
say
that
if
you
want
to
defend
the
countri
it
begin
with
border
secur
and
thi
is
where
I
have
had
my
disagr
with
senat
rubio
when
he
brought
forward
the
"gang
of
eight"
bill
to
give
citizenship
to
those
who
came
here
illeg
I
put
forward
an
amend
that
say
we
should
have
more
scrutini
on
those
who
are
come
as
student
those
who
are
come
as
immigr
those
who
are
come
as
refuge
becaus
we
had
two
refuge
come
to
my
town
in
bowl
green
and
tri
to
attack
us
marco
oppos
thi
becaus
they
made
a
deal
He
made
a
deal
with
chuck
schumer
that
he
would
oppos
ani
conserv
amend
and
I
think
that
a
mistak
and
I
just
do
not
think
marco
can
have
it
both
way
you
can not
be
in
favor
of
defend
us
[bell
rings]
against
islam
—
radic
islam
—
if
you
are
not
for
border
secur
governor
kasich
stand
back
you
appear
to
back
in
anoth
debat
a
so-cal
back

which
protect
most
smartphon
that
we

also
protect
the

now
the

right
warn
that
if
they
creat
a
way
for
the
fbi
to
have
a
back
door
into
our
encrypt
commun
then
the
bad
guy
will
exploit
it
too
and
they
say
that
thi
is
go
to
caus
more
secur
problem
than
it
would
solv
for
everyday
american
are
they
wrong?
but
thi
is
public
testimoni
but
I
just
have
to
tell
you
that
it
best
with
some
of
these
thing
not
be
said
now
I
want
to
go
back
someth
see
I
wa
there
when
reagan
rebuilt
the
militari
I
wa
there
in
89
when
the
wall
came
tumbl
down
becaus
we
were
strong
and
I
wa
there
when
we
went
into
the
gulf
war
We
did
not
win
that
war
just
from
the
air
we
won
that
war
by
assembl
a
group
of
arab
leader
who
stood
in
the
rose
garden
and
stood
with
america
We
want
to
destroy
isi
it
ha
to
be
in
the
air
and
on
the
ground
It
ha
to
be
with
our
friend
in
the
arab
world
and
our
friend
in
europ
the
coalit
that
we
had
when
we
went
to
the
first
gulf
war
and
then
when
we
win
that
and
we
will
win
that
against
isi
as
it
settl
down
and
we
should
leav
becaus
we
should
not
be
policemen
of
the
world
but
what
we
need
to
do
is
turn
it
over
to
the
region
power
to
be
abl
to
handl
that

senat

the
issu
of
climat
chang
in
2008
you
want
florida
to
get
ahead
of
other
state
and
establish
a
cap-
and-trad
system
a
program
for
carbon
emiss
which
mani
republican
thought
at
the
time
would
hurt
the
florida
economi
now
you
are
a
skeptic
of
climat
chang
scienc
and
in
fact
you
warn
that
feder
effort
to
fight
climat
chang
will
cost
US
job
and
hurt
the
US
economi
So
whi
the
change?
welcom
back
everyon
live

the
topic
of
immigr
senat

we
will
start
with
you
when
you
ran
for

you
made
clear
that
you
oppos
legal
and
citizenship
for
illeg
immigr
you
promis
repeatedli
that
you
would
oppos
it
as
a
US
senat
as
well
here
are
just
a
few
exampl
watch
[begin

never
support
never
have
and
never
will
support
ani
effort
to
grant
blanket
legal
amnesti
to
folk
who
have
enter
or
stay
in
thi
countri
illeg
[end

[begin
video

first
of
all
earn
path
to
citizenship
is
basic
code
for
amnesti
it
what
they
call
it
and
the
realiti
of
it
is
thi
it
is
unfair
to
the
peopl
that
have
legal
enter
thi
countri
to
creat
an
altern
for
individu
who
enter
illeg
and
knowingli
did
so
[end
video
clip]
[begin
video

within
two
year
of
get
elect
you
were
co-sponsor
legisl
to
creat
a
path
to
citizenship
in
your
word
amnesti
have
not
you
alreadi
proven
that
you
cannot
be
trust
on
thi
issue?
but
you
went
on
from
there
you
said
more
than
that
senat
you
said
earn
path
to
citizenship
is
basic
code
for
amnesti
you
support
earn
path
to
citizenship
governor
bush
do
you
agre
senat
rubio
ha
not
revers
himself
on
hi
immigr
promise?
bush:
well
i am
kind
of
confus
becaus
he
wa
the
sponsor
of
the
gang
of
eight
bill
that
did
requir
a
bunch
of
threshold
but
ultim
allow
for
citizenship
over
an
extend
period
of
time
I
mean
that
a
fact
and
he
ask
me
to
support
that
and
I
—
I
support
him
becaus
I
think
peopl
when
you
are
elect
you
need
to
do
thing
and
he
led
the
charg
to
final
fix
thi
immigr
problem
that
ha
exist
now
for
as
marco
say
for
30
year
and
then
he
cut
and
run
becaus
it
wa
not
popular
amongst
conserv
I
guess
here
what
I
believ
and
I
wrote
a
book
about
thi
call
immigr
war
you
can
get
it
at
$299
on
amazon
it
not
a
bestsel
I
can
promis
you
[laughter]
there
will not
be
ani
—
you
can
get
it
it
afford
for
everybodi
We
should
have
a
path
to
legal
statu
for
the
12
million
peopl
that
are
here
illeg
It
mean
come
out
from
the
shadow
pay
a
fine
earn
legal
statu
by
work
by
pay
tax
learn
english
not
commit
crime
and
earn
legal
statu
where
you
are
not
cut
in
front
of
the
line
for
peopl
that
are
patient
wait
outsid
[applause]
I
think
that
is
the
—
I
think
that
the
conserv
consensu
pragmat
approach
to
how
to
solv
thi
problem
Go
ahead
senat
it
interest
that
jeb
mention
the
book
that
the
book
where
you
chang
your
posit
on
immigr
becaus
you
use
to
support
a
path
to
citizenship
bush:
So
did
you
[laughter]
well
but
you
chang
the
—
in
the
book
bush:

So
did
you
marco
[applause]
all
right
bush:
but
when
you
did
not
do
that
and
you
ask
peopl
to
support
you
should
not
cut
and
run
all
right
thi
will
be
the
last
one
OK
let
move
on
senat
cruz
when
senat
rubio
propos
that
bill
creat
a
path
to
citizenship
you
propos
an
amend
It
would
have
allow

but
not
citizenship
ye
it
would
press
last
month
on
whi
you
support
legal
you
claim
that
you
did
not
right?
like
you
just
did
saw
that
[laughter]

thi
wa
just
a
poison
pill
