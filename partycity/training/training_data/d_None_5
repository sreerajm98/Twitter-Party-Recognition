gap
So

you
believ
that
secretari

the
judgment
to
be

and
that
what
the
surrog
were

the
intellig
to
be

Of
cours

[inaudible]
blitzer:
thank
you
senat

secretari
clint
the
govern
announc
yesterday
that
five
of
the
biggest
bank
on
wall
street
have
fail
to
develop
plan
to
dismantl
themselv
in
the
event
of
anoth
financi
crisi
thi
is
the
second
time
in
two
year
those
bank
neglect
to
come
up
with
credibl
plan
So
as
presid
would
you
call
on
regul
to
start
the
process
of
break
up
these
banks?
someth
that
the
law
not
onli
allow
but
actual
explicitli
encourages?
thank
you
secretari
senat
sander
you
were
recent
ask
what
you
would
replac
the
big
wall
street
bank
with
if
you
could
break
them
up
you
said
quot
"that
their
decision"
whi
would
you
trust
the
bank
to
restructur
themselves?
when
you
said
the
whole
busi
model
wa
fraudulent?
but
senat
but
senat
you
did
not
answer
the
specif
question
which
is
not
just
about
break
up
the
bank
but
whi
allow
the
bank
to
do
it
themselves?
becaus
i am
not
sure
that
the
govern
should
say
is
you
are
too
big
to
fail
you
have
got
to
be
a
certain
size
and
then
the
bank
themselv
can
figur
out
what
they
want
to
sell
off
I
do
not
know
that
it
appropri
that
the
depart
of
treasuri
to
be
make
those
decis
what
we
need
is
to
make
sure
that
they
are
safe
[applause]
thank
you
madam
secretari
senat
sander
you
have
consist
critic
secretari
clinton
for
accept
money
from

can
you
name
one
decis
that
she
made
as
senat
that
show
that
he
favor
bank
becaus
of
the
money
she
received?
sure
sure
the
obviou
decis
is
when
the
greed
and
reckless
and
illeg
behavior
of
wall
street
brought
thi
countri
into
the
worst
econom
downturn
sinc
the
great
recess
—
the
great
depress
of
the
30
when
million
of
peopl
lost
their
job
and
their
home
and
their
life
save
the
obviou
respons
to
that
is
that
you
have
got
a
bunch
of
fraudul
oper
and
that
they
have
got
to
be
broken
up
that
wa
my

do
that
now
secretari

the
way
he

your
contempt
for
larg
american
corpor
as

how
would
you
be
abl
to
promot
american
busi

first
of
all
the
word
contempt
is
not
right
there
are
some
great
busi
who
treat
their
worker
and
the
environ
with
respect
[applause]
verizon
happen
not
to
be

of
them
[applause]
and
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
tell
thi
guy
immelt
who
the
head
of
gener
electr
he
doe
not
like
me
well
that
fine
He
ha

tax
despit
make

[booing]
blitzer:
but
senat
expert
say
that
no
matter
the
mean
to
bring
back
these
job
to
the
unit
state
price
of
good
for
consum
in
the
unit
state
would
go
up
which
would
disproportion
impact
the
poor
and
middl
class
So
how
do
you
bring
back
these
job
to
the
unit

go
to
rais
the

to

buck

while
it
is
true
we
may
end
up
pay
a
few
cent
more
for
a
hamburg
in
mcdonald
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
thi
economi
desper
need
is
to
rebuild
our
manufactur
sector
with
good-pay
job
[applause]
We
cannot
continu
to
sustain
the
loss
of
million
of
decent-pay
job
that
we
have
seen
over
the
last
20
30
year
base
on
trade
agreement
of
which
secretari
clinton
ha
vote
for
almost
everi
one
of
those
that
ha
got
to
chang
blitzer:
thank
you
secretary[laughter]secretari
clinton?
[applause]
well
first
of
all
I
do
have
a
veri
comprehens
plan
to
creat
more
job
and
I
think
that
ha
to
be
at
the
center
of
our
econom
approach
and
so
I
think
it
is
import
that
we
do
more
on
manufactur
I
went
to
syracus
and
laid
out
a
$10
billion
plan
that
would
I
believ
realli
jump-start
advanc
manufactur
I
have
seen
the
result
of
what
can
happen
when
we
have
the
govern
cooper
with
busi
and
that
exactli
what
I
will
do
when
I
wa
secretari
of
state
I
help
to
lead
the
way
to
increas
export
of
american
good
around
the
world
which
support
ten
of
thousand
of
job
So
I
think
you
have
got
to
go
at
thi
with
a
sens
of
how
to
accomplish
the
goal
we
are
set
—
more
good
job
with
rise
incom
for
peopl
everywher
from
inner
citi
to

to
everi
distress
commun
in

and
that
exactli
what
my
plan
would
bring
about

think
we
have
a
pretti
good
record
if
we
look
at
what
happen

I
support

of

it

I
also
—
I
support
the
$15
effort
in
LA
I
support
in

I
support
it
for

fast
food
worker
in

the

right
now
is
$725
right?
We
want
to
rais
it
higher
than
it
ever
ha
been
but
we
also
have
to
recogn
some
state
and
some
citi
will
go
higher
and
I
support
that
I
have
taken
my
cue
from
the
democrat
in
the
senat
led
by
senat
patti
murray
and
other
like
my
good

kirsten

what

total
absurd
blitzer:
I
ask

are
you
serious
blame
vermont
and
implicitli
senat

for
new
york
gun
violenc
she
said
no
but
go
ahead
then
whi
did
she
put
out
that
statement?
I
put
it
out
excus
me
I
think
i am
respond
now
blitzer:
pleas
go
ahead
sir
No
I
do
not
think
I
owe
them
an
apolog
they
are
in
court
today
and
actual
they
won
a
preliminari
decis
today
they
have
the
right
to
sue
and
I
support
them
and
anyon
els
who
want
the
right
to
sue
the
nra
came
to
their
support
in
the
congress
and
said
stop
it
stop
it
now
and
senat
sander
join
those
who
did
blitzer:
thank
you
secretari
senat
go
ahead
well
I
think
that
it
had
some
posit
aspect
to
it
and
you
mention
some
of
them
the
violenc
against
women
act
which
ha
been
a
veri
import
piec
of
legisl
in
my
opinion
[applause]
and
it
also
did
some
thing
which
were
to
provid
more
opportun
for
young
peopl
So
if
we
were
to
have
the
balanc
sheet
on
one
side
there
are
some
posit
action
and
chang
On
the
other
side
there
were
decis
that
were
made
that
now
we
must
revisit
and
we
have
to
correct
I
think
that
sentenc
got
much
too
long
the
origin
idea
wa
not
that
we
would
increas
sentenc
for
non-viol
low-level
offend
but
onc
the
feder
govern
did
what
it
did
state
pile
on
So
we
have
a
problem
and
the
veri
first
speech
I
gave
in
thi
campaign
wa
about
what
I
will
do
to
reform
the
crimin
justic
system
and
end
the
over-mass
incarcer
So
I
think
that
if
all
of
us
go
and
look
back
at
where
we
were
senat
sander
vote
for
the
crime
bill
and
he
say
the
same
thing
there
were
some
good
thing
and
thing
that
we
have
to
chang
and
learn
from
So
that
how
I
see
it
and
I
think
we
ought
to
be
put
our
attent
on
forg
a
consensu
to
make
the
chang
that
will
divert
more
peopl
from
the
crimin
justic
system
to

To

earlier

that
if
the

then
quot
"it

Do

about
you

becaus
it
wa
a
racist
term
and
everybodi
knew
it
wa
a
racist
term
[applause]
look
much
of
what
secretari
clinton
said
wa
right
We
had
a
crime
bill
I
vote
for
it
It
had
the
violenc
against
women
act
in
it
when
as
mayor
of
burlington
we
work
veri
hard
to
tri
to
elimin
domest
violenc
thi
took
us
a
good
step
forward
We
are
talk
about
the
weapon
that
kill
the
children
in
sandi
hook
thi
ban
assault
weapon
not
insignific
but
where
we
are
today
is
we
have
a
broken
crimin
justic
system
We
have
more
peopl
in
jail
than
ani
other
countri
on
earth
and
in
my
view
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
rethink
the
system
from
the
bottom
on
up
and
that
mean
for
a
start
—
and
we
do
not
talk
about
thi
the
media
doe
not
talk
about
it
—
you
got
51
percent
of
african-american
kid
today
who
graduat
high
school
who
are
unemploy
or
underemploy
you
know
what
I
think?
mayb
we
invest
in
job
and
educ
for
those
kid
not
jail
and
incarcer

and
I
will
tell
you
what
els
and
I
will
tell
you
what
els
I
think
and
that
is
we
have
got
—
and
thi
is
the
differ
between
the
secretari
and
myself
as
I
understand
it
We
have
got
to
have
the
gut
to
rethink
the
so-cal

I
think
that
we
recogn
that
we
have
a
set
of

that
we
cannot
ignor
and
we
must
address
and
that
is
whi
I
have
been

for

I
think
the
idea
of

in

educ
univers
pre-k
like
what

We

to
take
a

break
We

more
question
for

clinton
and
senat

right
after
thi
[commerci

blitzer:
welcom
back
let
turn
to
anoth
critic
import
issu
senat
secretari
the
issu
of
energi
and
the
environ
secretari
clinton
senat
sander
ha
said
you
are
in
the
pocket
of
the
fossil
fuel
industri
you
say
you
are
sick
and
tire
of
him
lie
about
your
record
what
are
hi
lies?
well
let
me
start
by
say
we
need
to
talk
about
thi
issu
and
we
should
talk
about
it
in
term
of
the
extraordinari
threat
that
climat
chang
pose
to
our
countri
and
our
world
and
that
whi
for
the
last
mani
year
both
in
the
senat
and
as
secretari
of
state
it
been
a
big
part
of
my
commit
to
see
what
could
be
done
but
there
ha
never
been
ani
doubt
that
when
I
wa
a
senat
I
tri
—
I
join
with
other
to
tri
to
get
rid
of
the
subsidi
for
big
oil
and
I
have
propos
that
again
becaus
that
what
I
think
need
to
be
done
as
we
transit
from
fossil
fuel
to
clean
energi
and
everyon
who
look
at
thi
independ
"the
washington
post"
and
other
who
give
us
both
hard
time
when
call
for
on
fact
have
said
that
thi
is
absolut
an
incorrect
fals
charg
So
we
both
have
rel
small
amount
of
contribut
from
peopl
who
work
for
fossil
fuel
compani
best
we
can
tell
from
the
report
that
are
done
but
that
is
not
be
support
by
big
oil
and
I
think
it
import
to
distinguish
that
and
let u
talk
about
what
each
of
us
ha
propos
to
tri
to
combat
greenhous
ga
emiss
and
put

second
of
all
right

plan
which
is
current
under
attack
by

and
the

justic
that

ha
nomin
to

confirm
so
that
we

exactli
what
I

OK
thank

and
my
approach
I
think
is
go
to
get
us
there
faster
without
tie
us
up
into
polit
knot
with
a
congress
that
still
would
not

louis:

you
have
said
that
climat
chang
is
the
greatest
chang
to
our

secur
secretari

did

simpl
question
louis:
excus

that
climat
chang
is
the
greatest
threat
to
our

secur
you
have
call
for
a
nationwid
ban
on

you
have
also
call
for
phase
out
all
nuclear

in
the
US
but
would
not
those
propos
drive
the
countri
back
to
coal
and
oil
and
actual
undermin
your
fight
against
global
warming?
No
they
would
not
look
here
where
we
are
let
me
reiter
We
have
a
global
crisi
pope
franci
remind
us
that
we
are
on
a
suicid

some
peopl
who

and
we
build
into
our

an
enorm
amount
of

to
protect
those
worker
It
is
not
their
fault
that
fossil

are
destroy
our
climat
but
we
have
got
to
stand
up
and
say
right
now
as
we
would
if
we
were
attack
by
some
militari
forc
we
have
got
to
move
urgent
and
boldli
what
doe
that
mean?

of
all

come
from

and
20
percent
of
US

come
from

if
you
phase
out
all
of
that
how
do
you
make
up
that
deficit?
well
you
do
not
it
all
out
tomorrow
and
you
certainli
do
not
phase
nuclear
out
tomorrow
but
thi
is
what
you
do
do
[applause]
what
you

we

right
now
blitzer:
thank
you

well
let
me
say
I
think
we
did
a
great

what
we
did
We
help

someth
that

well
becaus
they
had
a
pent
up

to
tri
to
chart
their

futur
after
42
year
of

that
qadafi
had
get
it

of
american
expert
there
We
offer
to
help

secur
their

wolf
did
not
want
troop
from

other

not
just
us
european

so
we
were
caught
in
a
veri
difficult
posit
they
could
not
provid
secur
on
their
own
which
we
could
see
and
we
told
them
that
but
they
did
not
want
to
have
other
help
to
provid
that
secur
and
the
result
ha
been
a
clash
between
differ
part
of
the
countri
terrorist
take
up
some
locat
in
the
countri
and
we
can not
walk
away
from
that
We

know
you
are
not
shi
when
you
oppos
someth
senat
So
ye
it
wa
unanim
that
exactli
right
includ
you
and
what
we
did
wa
to
tri
to
provid
support
for
our
european
and
arab
alli
and
partner
the
decis
wa
the
presid
did
I
do
the
due
diligence?
did
I
talk
to
everybodi
I
could
talk
to?
did
I
visit
everi
capit
and
then
report
back
to
the
president?
ye
I
did
that
what
a
secretari
of
state
doe
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
those
are
the
decis
that
are
made
by
the
presid
to
in
ani
way
use
american
militari
power
and
the
presid
made
that
decis
and
ye
we
did
tri
without
success
becaus
of
the
libyan
obstruct
to
our
effort
but
we
did
tri
and
we
will
continu
to
tri
to
help
the
libyan
peopl
blitzer:
thank
you
secretari
Go
ahead
senat
If
you
listen
you
know
—
two
point
number
one
ye
100-0
in
the
senat
vote
for
democraci
in
libya
and
I
would
vote
for
that
again
but
that
is
veri
differ
from
get
activ
involv
to
overthrow
and
bring
about
regim
chang
without
fulli
understand
what
the
consequ
of
that
regim
chang
would
be
second
of
all
I
know
you
keep
refer
to
barack
obama
all
night
here
but
you
in
syria
you
in
syria
talk
about
a
no-fli
zone
which
the
presid
certainli
doe
not
support
nor
do
I
support
becaus
A
it
will
cost
an
enorm
sum
of
money
second
of
all
it
run
the
risk
of
get
us
suck
into
perpetu
warfar
in
that
region
thirdli
when
we
talk
about
syria
right
now
no
debat
like
gadhafi
like
saddam
hussein
assad
is
anoth
brutal
murder
dictat
but
right
now
our
fight
is
to
destroy
isi
first
and
to
get
rid
of
assad
second
senat
sander
in
1997
you
said
thi
about
nato
you
said
quote:
"it
is
not
the
time
to
continu
wast
ten
of
billion
of
dollar
help
to
defend
europ
let
alon
assum
more
than
our
share
of
ani
cost
associ
with
expand
nato"
Do
you
still
feel
that
way?
and
just
follow
up
senat
sander
donald
trump
also
argu
that
nato
is
unfair
econom
to
the
US
becaus
america
pay
a
disproportion
share
So
how
is
what
you
say
about
nato
and
your
propos
differ
than
his?
secretari
clinton?
but
madam
secretari
that
go
to
be
part
of
my
—
my
question
to
you
is
to
that
point
there
are
28
countri
in
the
allianc
and
the
unit
state
give
more
money
to
nato
budget
than
21
of
those
countri
combin
If
they
do
not
agre
to
pay
more
as
you
suggest
then
what
would
you
do
as
commander-in-chief?
I
will
stay
in
nato
I
will
stay
in
nato
and
we
will
continu
to
look
for
mission
and
other
kind
of
program
that
they
will
support
rememb
nato
wa
with
us
in
afghanistan
most
of
the
member
countri
also
lost
soldier
and
civilian
in
afghanistan
they
came
to
our
ralli
defens
after
9/11
that
meant
a
lot
and
ye
we
have
to
work
out
the
financi
aspect
of
it
but
let u
not
forget
what
realli
happen
with
russia
be
more
aggress
make
all
kind
of
intimid
move
toward
the
baltic
countri
we
have
seen
what
they
have
done
in
eastern
ukrain
we
know
how
they
want
to
rewrit
the
map
of
europ
it
is
not
in
our
interest
think
of
how
much
it
would
cost
if
russia
aggress
were
not
deter
becaus
nato
wa
there
on
the
front
line
make
it
clear
they
could
not
move
forward
[applause]
blitzer:
thank
you
secretari
senat
let u
talk
about
the
US
relationship
with
israel
senat
sander
you
maintain
that
israel
respons
in
gaza
in
2014
wa
quot
"disproportion
and
led
to
the
unnecessari
loss
of
innoc
life"
[applause]
what
do
you
say
to
those
who
believ
that
israel
ha
a
right
to
defend
itself
as
it
see
fit?
now
if
you
are
ask
not
just
me
but
countri
all
over
the
world
wa
that
a
disproportion
attack
the
answer
is
that
I
believ
it
wa
and
let
me
say
someth
els
[cheer

and
let
me
say
someth
els
As
somebodi
who
is
100%
pro-israel
in
the
long
run
—
and
thi
is
not
go
to
be
easi
god
onli
know
but
in
the
long
run
if
we
are
ever
go
to
bring
peac
to
that
region
which
ha
seen
so
much
hatr
and
so
much
war
we
are
go
to
have
to
treat
the
palestinian
peopl
with
respect
and
digniti
[cheer

So
what
is
not
to

to
say
that

in

I
believ
the
unit
state
and
the
rest
of
the
world
have
got
to
work
togeth
to
help
the
palestinian
peopl
that
doe
not
make
me
anti-israel
that
pave
the
way
I
think
blitzer:
thank
you
senat
to
an
approach
that
work
in
the
middl
east
[cheer

blitzer:
thank
you
secretari
clinton
do
you
agre
with
senat
sander
that
israel
overreact
to
palestinian
attack
and
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
peac
between
israel
and
the
palestinian
israel
must
quot
end
it
disproportion
responses?
I
negoti
the
cease-fir
between
israel
and
hama
in
novemb
of
2012
I
did
it
in
concert
with
[applause]
presid
abba
of
the

I
did

with

base
in

work
close
with
prime
minist
netanyahu
and
the
isra
cabinet
I
can
tell
you
right
now
I
have
been
there
with
isra
offici
go
back
more
than
25
year
that
they
do
not
seek
thi
kind
of
attack
they
do
not
invit
the
rocket
rain
down
on
their
town
and
villag
[applause]
they
do
not
believ
that
there
should
be
a
constant
incit
by
hama
aid
and
abet
by
iran
against
israel
and
so
when
it
came
time
after
they
had
taken
the
incom
rocket
taken
the
assault
and
ambush
on
their
soldier
and
they
call
and
told
me
I
wa
in
cambodia
that
they
were
get
readi
to
have
to
invad
gaza
again
becaus
they
could
not
find
anybodi
to
talk
to
tell

to
stop
it
I
flew

I

I
negoti

So
I
do
not
know
how
you
run
a
countri
when
you
are
under
constant
threat
terrorist
tact
rocket
come
at
you
you
have
a
right
to
defend
yourself
[applause]
that
doe
not
mean
—
that
doe
not
mean
that
you
do
not
take
appropri
precaut
and
I
understand
that
there
alway
second
guess
anytim
there
is
a
war
It
also
doe
not
mean
that
we
should
not
continu
to
do
everyth
we
can
to
tri
to
reach
a
two-stat
solut
which
would
give
the
palestinian
the
right
and
blitzer:
thank
you
just
let
me
finish
the
right
and
the
autonomi
that
they
deserv
and
let
me
say
thi
if
yasser
arafat
had
agre
with
my
husband
at
camp
david
in
the
late
1990
to
the
offer
then
prime
minist
barat
put
on
the
tabl
we
would
have
had
a
palestinian
state
for
15
year
[cheer

blitzer:
thank

senat
I
read

clinton
statement

I
heard
virtual
no
discuss
at
all
about
the
need
of
the
palestinian
peopl
almost
none
in
that
speech
[applause]
So
here
is
the
issue:
of
cours
israel
ha
a
right
to
defend
itself
but
long
term
there
will
never
be
peac
in
that
region
unless
the
unit
state
play
a
role
an
even-hand
role
tri
to
bring
peopl
togeth
and
recogn
the
seriou
problem
that
exist
among
the
palestinian
peopl
that
is
what
I
believ
the
world
want
to
us
do
and
that
the
kind
of
leadership
that
we
have
got
to
exercis
well
if
I
—
I
want
to
add
you
know
again
describ
the
problem
is
a
lot
easier
than
tri
to
solv
it
and
I
have
been
involv
both
as
first
ladi
with
my
husband
effort
as
a
senat
support
the
effort
that
even

as

for

i am
the
person
who
held
the

I

focus
on
what
we
need
to
do
to
make
sure
that
the
palestinian
peopl
had
the
right
to
self-govern
and
I
believ
that
as
presid
I
will
be
abl
to
continu
to
make
progress
and
get
an
agreement
that
will
be
fair
both
to

If

I
absolut
agre

go

strategi
on
thi
and
i am
not
go
to
engag
in

I
fulli

I
believ
that
the

—
the

is
on
the
right
side
of
both
the
constitut
and
histori
and
the
senat
need
to
immedi
begin
to
respond
So
i am
go

when
I
am
presid
I
will
take
stock
of
where
we
are
and
move
from

no

I

it
realli
is
an
outrag
and
it
just
continu
the
seven-and-a-half
year
of
unbeliev
obstruction
we
have
seen
from
these
right-w
republican
I
mean
a
third-grad
in

understand
the

the
right
to

would
you

point

i
will
strongli
support

would
ask

make
it
crystal
clear

done
that

consider
lead
in

in
the
deep
south
we
won
florida
texa
arizona
massachusett
ohio
illinoi
north

veri
confid
and
optimist
but
it
all
come
down
to

just
talk
about
veri
young
you
know
the
older
you
get
the
younger
young
get
—
45
or
younger
—
is
I
think
peopl
are
sens
that
establish
polit
and
depend
on
wall
street
and
big
money
interest
is
realli
never
go
to
address
the
crise
that
we
face
[applause]
and
peopl
understand
you
can not
take
money
from
power
special
interest
into
your
pac
and
then
realli
expect
the
american
peopl
to
believ
you
are
go
to
stand
up
to
these
power
special
interest
So
I
am
veri
proud
of
the
fact
that
we
have
brought
million
of
new
peopl
into
the
polit
process
blitzer:

I
grew
up
in
brooklyn
new

son
of
an
immigr
who
came
to
thi
countri
from

at
the
age
of
17
without

in
hi
pocket
never
made
a
whole
lot
of

wa
a
veri
proud
american
becaus
thi
countri
gave
him
and
my
mom
the
opportun
to
send
their

I
believ
that
thi

ha
enorm
potenti
if
we
have
the
gut
to
take
on
the
big
money
interest
who
domin
our
econom
and

life
and
I
disagre
with
secretari

in
the
belief
that
you

that
you
can
get
money
for
a

from

ha
to
be
done
for

famili
of
thi

just
do
not
accept

what
I
believ
is
that
thi
countri
if
we
stand
togeth
and
not
let
the
trump
of
the
world
divid
us
up
can
guarante
health
care

can
make

can
lead
the

in
transform
our
energi
system
and
combat
climat
chang
can
break
up
the
larg
financi
institut
can
demand
that
the
wealthiest
peopl
in
thi
countri
start
pay
their
fair
share
of
tax
and
we
can
do
that
when
million
of
peopl
stand
up
fight
back
and
creat
a
govern
that
work
for
all
of
us
not
just
the
1
percent

is
what
the

revolut
is
about

is
what
thi

is
about
and
