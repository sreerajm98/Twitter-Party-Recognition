they
believ
that
health

should
be
avail

all
of
our
peopl
i am
on
the

that
wrote

I
made
the

along
with
jim

a
better
piec

I
vote
for
it
but
right
now
what
we
have
to
deal
with
is
the
fact
that
29
million
peopl
still
have
no
health
insur
We
are
pay
the
highest
price
in
the
world
for
prescript
drug
get
rip
off
and
here
the
import
point
we
are
spend
far
more
per
person
on
health
care
than
the
peopl
of
ani
other
countri
My

all
peopl
get
privat

out
of

lower
the
cost
of

that
the
vision
we
need
to
take
[applause]
No
one
is
tear
thi
up
we
are
go
to
go
forward
but
with
the
secretari
neglect
to
mention
not
just
the
29
million
still
have
no
health
insur
that
even
more
are
underinsur
with
huge
copay
and
deduct
tell
me
whi
we
are
spend
almost
three
time
more
than
the
british
who
guarante
health

fifti
percent
more

harri
truman
wa
health

for
all

in
a

way
We
are
not
go
to
tear
up
the

I
help
write
it

we
are
go
to
move

I
think
instead
of
attack
one
anoth
on
health
care
we
should
be
talk
about
the
thing
that
are
actual
work
In
our
state
we
have
move
to
an
all-pay
system
with
the
afford
care
act
we
now
have
move
all
of
our
acut
care
hospit
that
driver
of
cost
at
the
center
away
from
fee-for-
servic
and
actual
to

we
pay
them
base
on
how
well
they
keep

We
need
to
build
on
the

act
do
the
thing
that

reduc

increas

and
that
exactli
what
we
are
abl
to
do
base
on
the
foundat
of
the
afford

act
—
what
governor
omalley
just
said
is
one
of
the
model
that
we
will
be
look
at
to
make
sure
we
do
get
cost
down
we
do
limit
a
lot
of
the
unnecessari
cost
that
we
still
have
in
the
system
but
with
all
due
respect
to
start
over
again
with
a
whole
new
debat
is
someth
that
I
think
would
set
us
back
the
republican
just
vote
last
week
to
repeal
the
afford
care
act
and
thank
good

veto
it
