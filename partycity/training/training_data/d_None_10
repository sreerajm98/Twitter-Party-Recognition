first
question
for
you
senat

come
from
gerri
ohd

say
she
is
an
undecid
voter
gerry?
question:
ye
senat
some
of
your
detractor
have
call
you
a
socialist
on
occas
and
you
do
not
seem
too
troubl
by
that
and
sometim
embrac
it
I
wonder
if
you
could
elabor
on
that
sure
question:
and
just
to
show
us
what
the
comfort
level
you
have
your
definit
of
it
so
that
it
doe
not
concern
the
rest
of
us
citizen
next
question
renea
seagren
she
a
nurs
she
say
she
undecid
she
see
how
healthcar
play
out
everyday
she
ha
a
concern
for
you
pleas
renea
question:
senat
sander
you
have
brand
your
program
your
singl
payer
health
program
as
"medicar
for
all"
and
medicar
ha
a
reput
of
have
some
problem
let
me
cite
one
exampl
a
man
in
our
clinic
went
into
the
donut
hole
in
septemb
and
could
not
afford
the
$1200
a
month
it
would
cost
him
for
insulin
So
he
had
to
decreas
hi
dose
to
make
hi
insulin
stretch
So
what
do
you
-
whi
do
you
think
that
peopl
would
support
your
medicar
for
all
program?
the
critic
is
[applause]
the
critic
is
to
pay
for
thi
what
you
are
realli
ask
for
is
one
of
the
biggest
tax
hike
in
histori
and
that
is
the
critic
but
just
to
be
clear
you
are
go
to
rais
tax
to
do
this?
all
right
next
question
sean
collison
law
student
at
drake
say
he
undecid
what
do
you
have?
sean
collison:
I
think
you
have
introduc
a
lot
of
program
that
could
help
a
lot
of
peopl
My
question
is
realist
how
do
we
fund
those
programs?
good
collison:
where
can
we
realloc
or
cut
spend
on
other
program
to
right
senat
then
the
pushback
becom
how
you
pay
now
in
thi
room
you
are
preach
to
the
convert
somewhat
right?
these
are
presumpt
democrat
but
you
will
hear
peopl
say
that
you
are
pay
for
it
is
actual
punit
you
are
go
to
punish
peopl
who
make
money
you
are
go
to
punish
the
financi
district
you
are
go
to
punish
and
wind
up
chang
the
idea
of
an
open
and
free
economi
becaus
you
are
go
to
punish
them
for
specul
which
mean
they
will not
specul
as
much
which
mean
you
will not
get
as
much
activ
and
if
you
do
a
checklist
of
how
you
pay
for
everyth
what
you
are
do
is
amass
the
biggest
govern
ever
after
presid
clinton
said
the
era
of
big
govern
wa
over
It
seem
like
berni
sander
is
say
not
onli
it
over
i am
go
to
do
it
bigger
than
ever
alright
we
got
to
put
what
I
am
do
in
context
and
here
the
context
today
in
america
we
have
more
incom
and
wealth
inequ
than
we
have
had
sinc
1928
there
ha
chri
been
a
massiv
transfer
of
wealth
i am
talk
about
trillion
of
dollar
from
the
pocket
of
work
famili
into
the
hand
of
the
top
one-tenth
of
one
percent
that
a
fact
So
if
you
are
tell
me
that
at
a
time
when
-
wall
street
reckless
greed
and
illeg
behavior
brought
thi
countri
to
it
knee
than
I
am
go
to
say
to
them
that
they
are
go
to
have
to
start
pay
their
fair
share
of
tax
fine
if
that
the
critic
I
accept
it
I
demand
that
wall
street
start
pay
it
fair
share
of
tax
second
of
all
[applause]
what
about
the
idea
that
you
are
bring
back
the
era
of
big
govern
and
make
it
bigger
than
ever?
they
do
not
critic
the
goal
they
critic
the
method
of
how
you
achiev
it
give
me
a
ye
or
no
on
that
Is
the
era
of
big
govern
back
with
presid
sanders?

given
the
ongo
gridlock
in

the
continu
republican
resist
toward

obama
initi
and
the
likelihood
that

that
what
hillari
clinton
repres
on
one
level
to
voter
that
she
would
be
the
first
femal
presid
and
there
is
someth
special
in

OK
here
the
question
practic
all
of
the
comment
that
have
been
said
for
both
-
all
three
candid
tonight
about
99
percent
have
been
on
some
form
of
domest
polici
and
yet
you
know
as
the
former
wife
of
a
presid
and
as
the
secretari
of
state
that
the
presid
of
the
unit
state
is
go
to
just
spend
more
than
50
percent
of
hi
or
her
time
on
foreign
polici
issu
So
therefor
I
think
it
import
for
the
public
to
kind
of
get
a
sens
of
where
you
may
be
come
from
across
the
board
philosoph
and
the
way
I
look
at
it
is
you
could
have
a
scale
of
say
one
to
100
and
on
that
scale
you
would
have
none
interventionist
on
one
side
at
one
and
total
interventionist
on
the
other
side
as
10
As
you
think
about
all
the
issu
that
you
have
confront
as
secretari
of
state
and
then
as
the
possibl
of
look
at
issu
into
the
futur
where
do
you
think
you
will
land
on
that
scale
of
one
to
10?

the
obama
administr
of
which

question
Hi
question:
good
even
secretari
sec
clinton
when
you
are
elect
the
next
presid
of
the
unit
state
what
will
you
say
to
republican
voters?
I
have
a
question
for
you
as
a
point
of
push
back
you
were
talk
earlier
about
how
it
difficult
to
form
a
coalit
with
peopl
who
are
be
insult
at
the
same
time
let
appli
that
to
the
democrat
and
the
republican
you
say
you
want
to
work
with
them
but
you
were
quot
not
too
long
ago
you
were
list
(ph)
peopl
that
you
saw
as
adversari
nra
health
insur
compani
probabl
the
republican
they
did
not
like
that
when
you
said
that
It
make
them
feel
that
well
secretari
clinton
doe
not
like
us
whi
would
she
work
with
us?
understand
So
what
is
it
insid
you
that
can
separ
the
human
feel
of
do
the
benghazi
hear
and
then
go
back
to
that
same
group
of
peopl
and
say
"ok
you
know
what?
let
put
that
in
the
past"
It
sound
a
littl
hard
to
do
alright
let u
get
you
anoth
question
zach
pieper
grew
up
in
west
de
moin
He
say
he
undecid
what
your
question
for
the
secretari
Hi
question:
secretari
clinton
kind
of
on
the
same
issu
as
the
bear
hug
I
think
one
thing
that
they
might
have
a
hard
time
bare
hug
with
the
other
side
and
certainli
a
concern
that
a
lot
of
democrat
voter
have
at
thi
point
as
far
as
go
to
the
gener
elect
and
look
forward
to
work
with
congress
is
the
benghazi
issu
So
how
are
you
plan
on
deal
with
that
go
forward
not
onli
in
the
gener
elect
but
also
if
you
becam
presid
work
with
congress

that
issu

de
moin
regist
as

said
earlier
gave
you

endors

question
your
judgment

the
email
issue?
they
said
and
you
know
thi
but
for
the
audienc
in
2008
"when
she
says"
-
"when
she
make
a
mistak
she
should
just
say
so"
thi
weekend
they
said
that
a
lesson
that
you
have
not
learn
ye
you
apolog
but
onli
when
you
need
to
not
when
you
first
could
have
fair
criticism?
you
are
will
to
say
it
wa
an
error
in

you

apolog
not
