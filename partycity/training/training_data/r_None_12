governor

Id
like
to
start
with
you
you
have
been
a
strong
advoc
for
these
trade
deal
over
the
year
critic
say
these
deal
are
great
for
corpor
america
bottom
line
but
have
cost
the
US
at
least
1
million
job
how
do

respond
to
the
critic
that
you
have
been
cater
to
board
room
at
the
expens
of
the
american
middl
class?
Mr
trump
your
critic
say
your
campaign
platform
is
inconsist
with
how
you
run
your
busi
note
that
you
have
brought
in
foreign
worker
instead
of
hire
american
and
your
compani
manufactur
cloth
in
china
and
mexico
whi
should
voter
trust
that
you
will
run
the
countri
differ
from
how
you
run
your
businesses?
senat
rubio
last
octob
you
said
that
you
are
quot
"gener
veri
much
in
favor
of
free
trade"
more
recent
you
back
a
away
from
your
support
of
some
trade
deal
If
elect
will
you
support
free
trade
deal
even
if
it
mean
the
inevit
loss
of
US
jobs?
senat
cruz
you
were
a
support
of
the
pacif
trade
deal
but
after
take
some
heat
from
conserv
you
chang
your
posit
whi
should
these
voter
who
do
not
like
these
trade
deal
trust
that
you
will
fight
for
them
all
the
time
and
not
just
in
elect
years?
let
talk
more
about
how
american
job
are
impact
by
foreign
worker
let
go
to
stephen
dinan
of
the
washington
time
stephen
dinan:
senat
rubio
in
late
2014
disney
laid
off
250
tech
worker
in
orlando
replac
mani
of
them
with
foreign
worker
some
of
the
american
even
had
to
train
their
own
replac
you
support
increas
the
h-1b
visa
program
that
made
it
possibl
to
bring
in
these
foreign
worker
doe
not
thi
program
take
job
away
from
americans?
If
it
be
abus
the
way
disney
did
understand
that
program
it
is
illeg
now
under
that
program
to
use
it
to
replac
american
worker
under
that
program
you
have
to
prove
not
onli
that
you
are
not
replac
american
but
that
you
have
tri
to
hire
american
and
if
a
compani
is
caught
abus
that
process
they
should
never
be
allow
to
use
it
again
the
second
problem
with
the
current
structur
of
the
program
that
peopl
perhap
do
not
understand
is
a
lot
of
these
compani
are
not
directli
hire
employe
from
abroad
they
are
hire
a
consult
compani
like
tata
for
exampl
out
of
india
that
compani
then
hoard
up
all
of
these
visa
they
hire
worker
you
hire
—
disney
or
some
other
compani
hire
thi
compani
what
they
are
basic
do
is
they
are
insourc
and
outsourc
they
are
bring
in
worker
from
abroad
that
are
not
direct
employe
of
a
disney
or
someon
els
they
are
employe
of
thi
consult
busi
and
what
I
argu
is
that
no
consult
busi
such
as
that
should
be
allow
to
hoard
up
all
of
these
visa
that
the
visa
should
onli
be
avail
for
compani
to
use
to
directli
hire
worker
and
that
we
should
be
stricter
in
how
he
enforc
it
It
is
illeg
now
it
is
a
violat
of
the
law
now
to
use
that
program
to
replac
american
and
if
a
compani
is
caught
do
that
whether
it
be
disney
or
anyon
els
they
should
be
bar
from
use
the
program
in
the
futur
dinan:
senat
rubio
real
quick
follow-up
on
thi
[applause]
you
have
—
in
the
—
in
the
context
of
illeg
immigr
you
have
call
for
basic
put
off
ani
legal
process
until
we
get
the
border
secur
correct
dinan:
whi
not
call
for
a
paus
on
h1b
until
those
abus
you
have
talk
about
are
solv
well
first
I
think
—
well
Id
be
open
to
it
if
it
take
a
paus
but
I
do
not
think
it
take
a
paus
to
enforc
the
law
what
they
are
do
is
they
are
in
fact
use
that
program
to
replac
an
american
If
there
an
american
work
at
disney
and
they
bring
someon
from
anoth
countri
use
h1b
to
replac
their
direct
job
that
in
violat
of
the
law
and
what
i am
explain
to
you
is
what
they
are
do
now
is
they
are
not
—
what
they
are
do
is
they
are
elimin
the
job
they
are
outsourc
the
entir
tech
divis
to
a
consult
compani
they
are
make
the
argument
that
we
did
not
replac
you
We
just
replac
the
whole
unit
by
hire
a
compani
to
do
it
instead
and
that
compani
that
they
are
hire
is
bring
their
worker
from
abroad
it
a
loophol
they
have
figur
out
that
we
need
to
close
so
they
can
no
longer
continu
to
do
it
that
way
[applause]
dinan:
governor
kasich
I
want
to
come
to
you
next
Mr
trump
say
that
legal
immigr
is
produc
quot
"lower
wage
and
higher
unemploy
for
US
workers"
he
call
for
a
paus
on
green
card
issu
to
foreign
worker
would
not
that
help
worker
in
the
us?
well
look
I
believ
in
immigr
but
it
ha
to
be
control
the
simpl
fact
of
the
matter
is
I
would
not
be
stand
here
Id
be
mayb
run
for
presid
of
croatia
if
we
did
not
have
immigr
immigr
is
someth
that
bring
youth
and
vibranc
and
energi
to
our
countri
but
we
clearli
have
to
control
our
border
We
can not
have
peopl
just
walk
in
look
we
lock
our
door
at
night
in
our
home
the
countri
ha
to
be
abl
to
lock
it
door
as
well
So
we
—
I
have
a
comprehens
plan
to
deal
with
thi
problem
of
immigr
I
would
say
we
have
to
absolut
finish
the
wall
and
guard
the
border
and
if
anybodi
were
to
come
in
after
that
they
are
go
to
have
to
go
back
No
excus
becaus
we
can not
continu
thi
problem
I
think
we
ought
to
have
a
guest
worker
program
where
peopl
come
in
work
and
go
home
and
I
think
at
the
same
time
for
the
11
and
a
half
million
who
are
here
then
in
my
view
if
they
have
not
commit
a
crime
sinc
they
have
been
here
they
get
a
path
to
legal
not
to
citizenship
I
believ
that
program
can
pass
the
congress
in
the
first
100
day
but
let u
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
whole
key
to
the
futur
of
america
is
strong
econom
growth
with
common
sens
regul
lower
tax
and
a
balanc
budget
We
can
have
a
rise
tide
that
lift
all
the
worker
in
america
all
the
peopl
who
are
citizen
of
america
if
we
will
just
follow
the
formula
that
work
that
I
use
in
washington
and
guess
what
I
have
use
it
in
ohio
to
grow
over
400
privat
sector
job
sinc
I
have
been
governor
dinan:
Mr
trump
I
do
want
to
come
to
you
will
you
also
in
your
answer
address
how
long
you
think
that
paus
would
be
and
what
that
paus
would
look
like
I
will
first
of
all
I
think
and
I
know
the
h1b
veri
well
and
it
someth
that
I
frankli
use
and
I
should
not
be
allow
to
use
it
We
should
not
have
it
veri
veri
bad
for
worker
and
second
of
all
I
think
it
veri
import
to
say
well
i am
a
businessman
and
I
have
to
do
what
I
have
to
do
when
it
sit
there
wait
for
you
but
it
veri
bad
it
veri
bad
for
busi
in
term
of
—
and
it
veri
bad
for
our
worker
and
it
unfair
for
our
worker
and
we
should
end
it
veri
importantli
the
disney
worker
endors
me
as
you
probabl
read
and
I
got
a
full
endors
becaus
they
are
the
one
that
said
and
they
had
a
news
confer
and
they
said
he
the
onli
one
that
go
to
be
abl
to
fix
it
becaus
it
is
a
mess
I
think
for
a
period
of
a
year
to
two
year
we
have
to
look
back
and
we
have
to
see
just
to
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question
where
we
are
where
we
stand
what
go
on
We
have
to
sort
of
take
a
strong
good
hard
look
and
come
up
with
plan
that
work
and
we
are
rush
into
thing
and
we
are
just
—
we
are

We
are

with

OK

just

were

Mr

I
want
to
ask
you
about
someth
els
you
have
said
dure
the
cours
of
thi
campaign
you
said
that
the
US
ha
to
quot
"take
out"
the
famili
of
terrorist
when
it
wa
point
out
that
target
civilian
is
against
the
geneva
convent
you
said
quot
"so
they
can
kill
us
but
we
can not
kill
them?"
It
is
against
feder
militari
and
intern
law
to
target
civilian
So
how
will
you
order
the
militari
to
target
the
famili
of
suspect
terrorist
while
also
abid
by
the
law?
senat
rubio
would
you
as
presid
pursu
a
polici
of
target
the
famili
of
suspect
terrorists?
senat
cruz
you
have
talk
about
chang
the
rule
of
engag
in
battl
against
isi
would
that
includ
target
the
famili
of
suspect
terrorists?
No
of
cours
not
We
have
never
target
innoc
civilian
and
we
are
not
go
to
start
now
but
listen
jake
I
understand
peopl
are
scare
and
for
seven
year
we
have
face
terrorist
attack
and
presid
obama
lectur
american
on
islamophobia
that
is
madden
but
the
answer
is
not
simpli
to
yell
"china
bad
muslim
bad"
you
have
got
to
understand
the
natur
of
the
threat
we
are
face
and
how
you
deal
with
them
and
ye
it
is
true
there
are
million
of
radic
islam
terrorist
who
seek
to
kill
us
We
need
a
presid
command
in
chief
focus
on
fight
them
and
I
will
tell
you
frankli
one
concern
I
have
with
donald
is
that
although
hi
languag
is
quit
incendiari
when
you
look
at
hi
substant
polici
on
iran
he
ha
said
he
would
not
rip
up
thi
iranian
nuclear
deal
I
think
that
a
mistak
the
ayatollah
khomeini
want
nuclear
weapon
to
murder
us
I
will
give
you
anoth
exampl
deal
with
islam
radic
terror
On
israel
donald
ha
said
he
want
to
be
neutral
between
israel
and
the
palestinian
As
presid
I
will
not
be
neutral
and
let
me
say
thi
week
a
texan
taylor
forc
He
wa
an
eagl
scout
he
wa
a
west
point
graduat
he
wa
an
armi
veteran
He
wa
murder
by
a
palestinian
terrorist
thi
week
in
israel
and
I
do
not
think
we
need
a
command
in
chief[bel
rings]who
is
neutral
between
the
palestinian
terrorist
and
one
of
our
strongest
alli
in

on
the
quot
that
senat
cruz
use
you
said
you
would
want
to
be
quot
"sort
of

He
did
mention
taylor
forc
He
wa
a
west

the

polici
there

becaus
there
no

Mr

are

the

if
in

If
we
arriv
on

of

eri
donald

ha
the
most
deleg
whi
should
not
the
person
with
the
most
deleg
even
if
it
not
a
major
of
deleg
be
the
nominee?
well
first
of
all
let u
not
—
you
know
math
doe
not
tell
the
whole
stori
in
polit
the
great
thing
about
polit
the
reason
whi
we
watch
it
is
becaus
what
true
today
is
not
necessarili
true
tomorrow
So
let u
not
get
ahead
of
ourselv
secondli
look
when
you
went
to
school
up
there
in
salem
ohio
OK
If
you
got
an
86
you
got
a
B
becaus
everybodi
els
had
an
84
did
not
mean
you
got
an
A
So
you
just
have
to
win
enough
deleg
to
be
the
nomine
and
frankli
I
do
not
know
if
we
are
go
to
get
a
convent
like
that
but
if
we
do
I
wa
at
one
in
1976
as
a
wee
lad
and
support
ronald
reagan
and
actual
work
directli
with
him
He
tri
valiantli
He
lost
gerald
ford
won
the

wa
unit
gerald
ford
serv
the

great
by

richard

He
lost
the
elect
probabl
becaus
of
that
but
he
put
america
first
and
we
were
heal
as
a
parti
So
look
you
have
to
earn
the
deleg
in
order
to
be
pick
but
let u
not
get
ahead
of
ourselv
We
do
not
know
what
go
to
happen
becaus
we
still
have
about
half
the
deleg
to
be
select
and
that
what
go
to
be
a
veri
interest
thing
to
see
how
it
all
turn
out
as
we
move
forward
over
the
next
coupl
of
week
[applause]
hewitt:
thank
you
governor
Mr

if
you
arriv
in
cleveland
with
a
plural
and
the
most
but
not
a
major
is
it
legitim
for
someon
els
to
emerg
from
that
convent
the
nominee?
and
if
so
would
you
support
that
person?
I
think
that
what
should
happen
get
back
mayb
a
littl
bit
to
your
first
question
I
think
that
whoever
—
first
of
all
I
think
i am
go
to
have
the
deleg
ok?
I
think
let
see
what
happen
[applause]
but
if
somebodi
doe
not
have
the
deleg
and
I
guess
there
two
of
us
up
here
that
can
and
there
are
two
of
us
that
cannot
at
thi
moment
but
if
—
no
that
just
—
by
the
way
that
is
not
meant
to
be
a
critic
that
just
a
mathemat
fact
ok?
If
two
of
us
get
up
there
I
would
say
thi
if
—
if
marco
if
the
governor
if
ted
had
more
vote
than
me
in
the
form
of
deleg
I
think
whoever
get
to
the
top
posit
as
oppos
to
solv
that
artifici
number
that
wa
by
somebodi
which
is
a
veri
random
number
I
think
that
whoever
get
the
most
deleg
should
win
that
what
I
think
hewitt:
senat

if
you

if
you

will

you
can
be
flexibl
about
idea
you
should
not
be
flexibl
about
your
principl
about
when
it
come
to
idea
and
work
with
peopl

have
a
record
of
have
done
that
listen
on
the
issu
of
higher
educ
i am
the
onli
one
that
continu
talk
about
student
loan
debt
becaus
I
owe
over
$100000
of
student
loan
debt
So
I
know
thi
is
a
major
issu
and
all
my
idea
that
deal
with
higher
educ
are
bipartisan
the
VA
account
act
that
I
pass
I
did
it
on
a
—
on
a
bipartisan
basi

sanction
that
I
help

that
I
impos
on
hezbollah

did
it
on
a
bipartisan
basi
the
girl
count
act
that
deal
with
human
traffick
we
did
that
on
a
bipartisan
basi
but
I
also
want
to
be
frank
there
are
issu
we
are
go
to
have
to
have
an
elect
over
when
it
come
to
repeal
and
replac
obamacar
that
not
go
to
be
bipartisan
when
it
come
to
reduc
the
tax
burden
on
american
that
not
go
to
be
bipartisan
when
it
come
to
shrink
the
size
of
the
feder
bureaucracythat
probabl
not
go
to
be
bipartisan
there
are
issu
we
can
work
togeth
on
and
we
should
but
there
are
fundament
issu
about
the
proper
role
of
govern
and
on
those
issu
I
will
fight
anyon
who
want
to
expand
