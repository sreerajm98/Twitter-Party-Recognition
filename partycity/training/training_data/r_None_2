thank
you
Mr
trump
Mr
trump
you
are
first
thank
you
secretari
clinton
Mr
trump
in
decemb
you
said
thi
"donald
J
trump
is
call
for
a
total
and
complet
shutdown
of
muslim
enter
the
unit
state
until
our
countri
repres
can
figur
out
what
the
hell
is
go
on
We
have
no
choic
We
have
no
choice"
your
run
mate
said
thi
week
that
the
muslim
ban
is
no
longer
your
posit
Is
that
correct?
and
if
it
is
wa
it
a
mistak
to
have
a
religi
test?
and
whi
did
it
morph
into
that?
No
did
you—no
answer
the
question
Do
you
still
believ
I
do
would
you
pleas
explain
whether
or
not
the
muslim
ban
still
stands?
well
first
of
all
I
will
not
let
anyon
into
our
countri
that
I
think
pose
a
risk
to
us
but
there
are
a
lot
of
refuge
women
and
children—think
of
that
pictur
we
all
saw
of
that
4-year-old
boy
with
the
blood
on
hi
forehead
becaus
hed
been
bomb
by
the
russian
and
syrian
air
forc
there
are
children
suffer
in
thi
catastroph
war
larg
I
believ
becaus
of
russian
aggress
and
we
need
to
do
our
part
We
by
no
mean
are
carri
anywher
near
the
load
that
europ
and
other
are
but
we
will
have
vet
that
is
as
tough
as
it
need
to
be
from
our
profession
our
intellig
expert
and
other
but
it
is
import
for
us
as
a
polici
you
know
not
to
say
as
donald
ha
said
we
are
go
to
ban
peopl
base
on
a
religion
how
do
you
do
that?
We
are
a
countri
found
on
religi
freedom
and
liberti
how
do
we
do
what
he
ha
advoc
without
caus
great
distress
within
our
own
county?
are
we
go
to
have
religi
test
when
peopl
fli
into
our
country?
and
how
do
we
expect
to
be
abl
to
implement
those?
So
I
thought
that
what
he
said
wa
extrem
unwis
and
even
danger
and
inde
you
can
look
at
the
propaganda
on
a
lot
of
the
terrorist
site
and
what
donald
trump
say
about
muslim
is
use
to
recruit
fighter
becaus
they
want
to
creat
a
war
between
us
and
the
final
thing
I
would
say
thi
is
the
10th
or
12th
time
that
he
deni
be
for
the
war
in
iraq
We
have
it
on
tape
the
entir
press
corp
ha
look
at
it
it
been
debunk
but
it
never
stop
him
from
say
whatev
he
want
to
say
So
pleas
go
to
hillaryclintoncom
and
you
can
see
it
there
been
lot
of
fact-check
on
that
Id
like
to
move
