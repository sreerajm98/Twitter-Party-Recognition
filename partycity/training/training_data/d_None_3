segment
We
move
into
our
next
segment
talk
about
america
direct
and
let u
start
by
talk
about
race
the
share
of
american
who
say
race
relat
are
bad
in
thi
countri
is
the
highest
it
been
in
decad
much
of
it
amplifi
by
shoot
of
african-american
by
polic
as
we
have
seen
recent
in
charlott
and
tulsa
race
ha
been
a
big
issu
in
thi
campaign
and
one
of
you
is
go
to
have
to
bridg
a
veri
wide
and
bitter
gap
So
how
do
you
heal
the
divide?
secretari
clinton
you
get
two
minut
on
thi
secretari
clinton?
ugh
secretari
clinton
last
week
you
said
we
have
got
to
do
everyth
possibl
to
improv
polic
to
go
right
at
implicit
bia
Do
you
believ
that
polic
are
implicitli
bias
against
black
people?
first
of
all
I
agre
and
a
lot
of
peopl
even
within
my
own
parti
want
to
give
certain
right
to
peopl
on
watch
list
and
no-
fli
list
I
agre
with
you
when
a
person
is
on
a
watch
list
or
a
no-fli
list
and
I
have
the
endors
of
the
nra
which
i am
veri
proud
of
these
are
veri
veri
good
peopl
and
they
are
protect
the
second
amend
but
I
think
we
have
to
look
veri
strongli
at
no-fli
list
and
watch
list
and
when
peopl
are
on
there
even
if
they
should
not
be
on
there
we
will
help
them
we
will
help
them
legal
we
will
help
them
get
off
but
I
tend
to
agre
with
that
quit
strongli
I
do
want
to
bring
up
the
fact
that
you
were
the
one
that
brought
up
the
word
super-pred
about
young
black
youth
and
that
a
term
that
I
think
wa
a—its—it
been
horribl
met
as
you
know
I
think
you
have
apolog
for
it
but
I
think
it
wa
a
terribl
thing
to
say
and
when
it
come
to
stop-and-frisk
you
know
you
are
talk
about
take
gun
away
well
i am
talk
about
take
gun
away
from
gang
and
peopl
that
use
them
and
I
do
not
think—i
realli
do
not
think
you
disagre
with
me
on
thi
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
I
think
mayb
there
a
polit
reason
whi
you
can not
say
it
but
I
realli
do
not
believe—in
new
york
citi
stop-and-frisk
we
had
2,200
murder
and
stop-and-frisk
brought
it
down
to
500
murder
five
hundr
murder
is
a
lot
of
murder
it
hard
to
believ
500
is
like
suppos
to
be
good?
but
we
went
from
2,200
to
500
and
it
wa
continu
on
by
mayor
bloomberg
and
it
wa
termin
by
current
mayor
but
stop-and-
frisk
had
a
tremend
impact
on
the
safeti
of
new
york
citi
tremend
beyond
belief
So
when
you
say
it
ha
no
impact
it
realli
did
It
had
a
veri
veri
big
impact
No
you
are
wrong
you
are
wrong
murder
are
up
all
right
you
check
it
Mr
trump
let
me
[crosstalk]
Mr
trump
I
secretari
clinton?
our
next
segment
is
call
"secur
america"
We
want
to
start
with
a
21st
centuri
war
happen
everi
day
in
thi
countri
our
institut
are
under
cyber
attack
and
our
secret
are
be
stolen
So
my
question
is
who
behind
it?
and
how
do
we
fight
it?
secretari
clinton
thi
answer
goe
to
you
your
two
minut
have
expir
secretari
clinton?
secretari
clinton?
wrong
wrong
wrong
the
secretari
said
veri
strongli
about
work
with—w
have
been
work
with
them
for
mani
year
and
we
have
the
greatest
mess
anyon
ever
seen
you
look
at
the
middl
east
it
a
total
mess
under
your
direct
to
a
larg
extent
but
you
look
at
the
middl
east
you
start
the
iran
deal
that
anoth
beauti
where
you
have
a
countri
that
wa
readi
to
fall
I
mean
they
were
do
so
badli
they
were
choke
on
the
sanction
and
now
they
are
go
to
be
actual
probabl
a
major
power
at
some
point
pretti
soon
the
way
they
are
go
but
when
you
look
at
nato
I
wa
ask
on
a
major
show
what
do
you
think
of
nato?
and
you
have
to
understand
i am
a
businessperson
I
did
realli
well
but
I
have
common
sens
and
I
said
well
I
will
tell
you
I
have
not
given
lot
of
thought
to
nato
but
two
thing
number
one
the
28
countri
of
nato
mani
of
them
are
not
pay
their
fair
share
number
two—and
that
bother
me
becaus
we
should
be
asking—w
are
defend
them
and
they
should
at
least
be
pay
us
what
they
are
suppos
to
be
pay
by
treati
and
contract
and
number
two
I
said
and
veri
strongli
nato
could
be
obsolet
because—and
I
wa
veri
strong
on
thi
and
it
wa
actual
cover
veri
accur
in
the
new
york
time
which
is
unusu
for
the
new
york
time
to
be
honest—but
I
said
they
do
not
focu
on
terror
and
I
wa
veri
strong
and
I
said
it
numer
time
and
about
four
month
ago
I
read
on
the
front
page
of
the
wall
street
journal
that
nato
is
open
up
a
major
terror
divis
and
I
think
that
great
and
I
think
we
should
get—becaus
we
pay
approxim
73
percent
of
the
cost
of
nato
it
a
lot
of
money
to
protect
other
peopl
but
i am
all
for
nato
but
I
said
they
have
to
focu
on
terror
also
and
they
are
go
to
do
that
and
that
was—believ
me—im
sure
i am
not
go
to
get
credit
for
it—but
that
wa
larg
becaus
of
what
I
wa
say
and
my
critic
of
nato
I
think
we
have
to
get
nato
to
go
into
the
middl
east
with
us
in
addit
to
surround
nation
and
we
have
to
knock
the
hell
out
of
isi
and
we
have
to
do
it
fast
when
isi
form
in
thi
vacuum
creat
by
barack
obama
and
secretari
clinton
and
believ
me
you
were
the
one
that
took
out
the
troop
not
onli
that
you
name
the
day
they
could
not
believ
it
they
sat
back
probabl
and
said
I
can not
believ
it
they
said
No
wait
a
minut
secretari
clinton?
that
would
not
start
a
war
No
they
were
taunt
us
wrong
it
lie
that
line
get
a
littl
bit
old
I
must
say
I
would
like
to
all
right
mr
clinton
secretari
clinton
you
have
two
minut
your
two
minut
