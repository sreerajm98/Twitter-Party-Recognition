presidenti
nomin
Mr

I
have
a
question
for
you

to
on
the
one
hand
be
firm
but
also
be
flexibl
you

been
flexibl
and
chang
your
opinion
on
a
number
of
thing
from
abort
to
hillari
clinton
but
you
have
said
rightli
that
it
just
like
ronald
reagan
who
chang
hi
mind

thing
but
at
the
same
time
you
are
critic
senat
cruz
