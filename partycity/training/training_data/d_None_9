60-
second
open
statement
from
each
of
the
candid

as
agre
to
in

by

two
campaign
we
are
go
to
begin
tonight
with
senat
sander
thank
you
senat
secretari
clinton
all
right
let
get
start
secretari
clinton
last
night
you
cite
the
concord
monitor
when
you
said
of
senat
sander
that
quot
"it
veri
hard
to
see
how
ani
of
hi
propos
could
ever
be
achievable"
So
pleas
tell
us
whi
you
think
if
he
elect
presid
on
a
platform
of
promis
thing
like
free
public
colleg
and
univers
healthcar
that
he
cannot
achiev
those
thing
thank
you
secretari
senat
sander
so
just
explain
how
you
spent
nearli
two
decad
in
congress
and
have
not
gotten
ani
of
these
thing
pass
whi
do
you
think
as
presid
you
will
be
abl
to
achiev
big
big
new
program
like
this?
well
I
have
not
quit
run
for
presid
befor
[laughter
and
applause]
let
deal
with
some
of
the
comment
that
secretari
clinton
made
and
by
the
way
you
know
sometim
there
a
lot
of
drama
here
I
have
known
secretari
clinton
for
25
year
and
respect
her
veri
much
here
is
the
issu
everi
major
countri
on
earth
whether
it
the
UK
whether
it
franc
whether
it
canada
ha
manag
to
provid
healthcar
to
all
peopl
as
a
right
and
they
are
spend
significantli
less
per
capita
on
health
care
than
we
are
So
I
do
not
accept
the
belief
that
the
unit
state
of
america
can not
do
that
I
do
not
accept
the
belief
that
the
unit
state
of
america
and
our
govern
can not
stand
up
to
the
ripoff
of
the
pharmaceut
industri
which
charg
us
by
far
the
highest
price
in
the
world
for
prescript
drug
number
two
in
the
economi
today
everybodi
understand
that
we
need
a
well
educ
workforc
thi
is
2016
when
we
talk
about
public
educ
it
can
no
longer
be
K
through
12th
grade
I
do
believ
that
public
colleg
and
univers
should
be
tuition
free
well
how
do
we
pay
for
that?
it
an
expens
proposit
I
do
believ
that
we
should
substanti
lower
student
debt
in
thi
countri
which
is
crush
million
of
peopl
We
pay
for
it
in
my
view
by
a
tax
on
wall
street
specul
the
middl
class
bail
out
wall
street
in
their
time
of
need
now
it
is
wall
street
time
to
help
the
middl
class
[applause]
If
I
could
just
follow
up
on
that
[applause]
there
is
no
disagr
between
us
on
univers
coverag
for
health
care
the
disagr
is
where
do
we
start
from
and
where
do
we
end
up
the
republican
want
to
repeal
the
afford
care
act
I
want
to
improv
it
I
want
to
build
on
it
get
the
cost
down
get
prescript
drug
cost
down
senat
sander
want
us
to
start
all
over
again
thi
wa
a
major
achiev
of
presid
obama
of
our
countri
It
is
help
peopl
right
now
I
am
not
go
to
wait
and
have
us
plung
back
into
a
contenti
nation
debat
that
ha
veri
littl
chanc
of
succeed
let
make
the
afford
care
act
work
for
everybodi
[applause]
Go
ye
go
ahead
secretari
clinton
senat
sander
is
campaign
against
you
now
at
thi
point
in
the
campaign
basic
argu
that
you
are
not
progress
enough
to
be
the
democrat
nomine
He
ha
said
that
if
you
vote
for
the
iraq
war
if
you
are
in
favor
of
the
death
penalti
if
you
wobbl
on
thing
like
the
keyston
pipelin
or
tpp
if
you
said
singl
payer
health
care
could
never
happen
then
you
are
too
far
to
the
right
of
the
democrat
parti
to
be
the
parti
standard
bearer
given
those
polici
posit
whi
should
liber
democrat
support
you
and
not
senat
sanders?
senat
sander
have
you
establish
a
list
of
what
it
mean
to
be
a
progress
that
is
unrealistic?
secretari
clinton
go
ahead
[inaudible]
30
second
and
then
we
will
move
that
right
I
mean
instead
of
argu
about
definit
let u
talk
about
well
you
began
it
yesterday
with
your
comment
senat
sander
as
a
vermont
you
have
almost
a
home
state
advantag
here
in
new
hampshir
but
back
home
across
the
border
you
also
have
a
long
histori
of
run
against
democrat
as
a
third-parti
candid
for
governor
senat
for
congress
In
1988
your
candidaci
as
a
third-parti
candid
arguabl
cost
the
democrat
a
congression
seat
and
sent
a
republican
instead
how
can
you
lead
the
democrat
parti
nation
when
you
have
not
been
a
member
of
the
democrat
parti
until
veri
recently?
secretari
clinton
how
do
you
see
it?
secretari
senat
sander
you
will
have
30
second
to
respond
to
that
what
be
part
of
the
establish
is
is
in
the
last
quarter
have
a
super
pac
that
rais
$15
million
from
wall
street
that
throughout
one
life
rais
a
whole
lot
of
money
from
the
drug
compani
and
other
special
interest
To
my
mind
if
we
do
not
get
a
handl
on
money
in
polit
and
the
degre
to
which
big
money
control
the
polit
process
in
thi
countri
nobodi
is
go
to
bring
about
the
chang
that
is
need
in
thi
countri
for
the
middl
class
and
work
famili
yeah
but
i—i
think
it
fair
to
realli
ask
what
behind
that
comment
you
know
senat
sander
ha
said
he
want
to
run
a
posit
campaign
I
have
tri
to
keep
my
disagr
over
issu
as
it
should
be
but
time
and
time
again
by
innuendo
by
insinu
there
is
thi
attack
that
he
is
put
forth
which
realli
come
down
to—you
know
anybodi
who
ever
took
donat
or
speak
fee
from
ani
interest
group
ha
to
be
bought
and
I
just
absolut
reject
that
senat
and
I
realli
do
not
think
these
kind
of
attack
by
insinu
are
worthi
of
you
and
enough
is
enough
If
you
have
got
someth
to
say
say
it
directli
but
you
will
not
find
that
I
ever
chang
a
view
or
a
vote
becaus
of
ani
donat
that
I
ever
receiv
what
[applause]
and
I
have
stood
up
and
I
have
repres
my
constitu
to
the
best
of
my
abil
and
i am
veri
proud
of
that
you
know
So
I
think
it
time
to
end
the
veri
art
smear
that
you
and
your
campaign
have
been
carri
out
[inaudible]
[applause]
in
recent
week
and
let u

lets—let
let
us

lets—lets—let
talk
about

and
so—let
talk
about
issu
let

talk
about
issu
all
right?
let
talk
about
whi
in
the
1990
wall
street
got
deregul
did
it
have
anyth
to
do
with
the
fact
that
wall
street
provided—sp
billion
of
dollar
on
lobbi
and
campaign
contributions?
well
some
peopl
might
think
yeah
that
had
some
influenc
[laughter]
let
ask
whi
it
is
that
we
pay
by
far
the
highest
price
in
the
world
for
prescript
drug
and
your
medicin
can
be
doubl
tomorrow
and
there
noth
that
the
govern
can
do
to
stop
it
you
think
it
ha
anyth
to
do
with
the
huge
amount
of
campaign
contribut
and
lobbi
from
the
fossil
fuel
industry?
let
talk
about
climat
chang
Do
you
think
there
a
reason
whi
not
one
republican
ha
the
gut
to
recogn
that
climat
chang
is
real
and
that
we
need
to
transform
our
energi
system?
Do
you
think
it
ha
anyth
to
do
with
the
koch
brother
and
exxonmobil
pour
huge
amount
of
money
into
the
polit
system?
that
is
what
goe
on
in
america
I
am
not—i
like[applause]ther
is
a
reason
you
know
there
is
a
reason
whi
these
peopl
are
put
huge
amount
of
money
into
our
polit
system
and
in
my
view
it
is
undermin
american
democraci
and
it
is
allow
congress
to
repres
wealthi
campaign
contributor
and
not
the
work
famili
of
thi

secretari

and
campaign
financ

you

against
big

but
do
you
realiz
there
is
one
public
financ
system
that

secretari

senat

you
have
been
a
critic
of
secretari
clinton
take
those
speak
fee
and
have
donat
from
wall
street
what
about
her
defens
of
her
record?
let
me
just
say
thi
wall
street
is
perhap
the
most
power
econom
and
polit
forc
in
thi
countri
you
have
compani
like
goldman
sach
who
just
recent
paid
a
settlement
fine
with
the
feder
govern
for
$5
billion
for
defraud
investor
goldman
sach
wa
one
of
those
compani
whose
illeg
activ
help
destroy
our
economi
and
ruin
the
live
of
million
of
american
but
thi
is
what
a
rig
economi
and
a
corrupt
campaign
financ
system
and
a
broken
crimin
justic
is
about
these
guy
are
so
power
that
not
one
of
the
execut
on
wall
street
ha
been
charg
with
anyth
after
pay
in
thi
case
of
goldman
sach
a
$5
billion
fine
kid
get
caught
with
marijuana
that
kid
ha
a
polic
record
A
wall
street
execut
destroy
the
economi
$5
billion
settlement
with
the
govern
no
crimin
record
that
is
what
power
is
about
that
is
what
corrupt
is
about
and
that
is
what
ha
to
chang
in
the
unit
state
of
america
[applause]
[crosstalk]
If
I
could
let
me
just
say
that
of
cours
it
ha
to
chang
It
ha
to
chang
and
that
whi
I
have
put
forward
a
plan
to
do
just
that
and
it
been
judg
to
be
the
toughest
most
effect
and
comprehens
one
I
have
great
respect
for
senat
sanderss
commit
to
tri
to
restor
glass-steagal
but
I
do
not
believ
that
that
is
enough
and
in
fact
I
do
not
believ
it
realli
address
a
lot
of
the
biggest
issu
we
have
you
know
we
now
have
power
under
the
dodd-frank
legisl
to
break
up
bank
and
I
have
said
I
will
use
that
power
if
they
pose
a
system
risk
but
I
want
to
go
further
becaus
it
wa
invest
bank
it
wa
insur
compani
it
wa
mortgag
compani
all
of
which
contribut
So
let u
not
just
be
narrowli
focus
on
one
part
of
the
problem
We
have
a
lot
of
issu
with
corpor
power
that
have
to
be
address
My
plan
take
us
further
and
it
would
do
the
job
[crosstalk]
[applause]
I
would
say
that—that
folk
who
have
look
at
thi
issu
for
a
long
time
whether
it
elizabeth
warren
or
mani
other
economist
will
tell
you
that
right
now
ye
we
do
need
a
21st
centuri
glass-steagal
legisl
and
I
would
tell
you
also
that
when
you
have
three
out
of
the
four
largest
bank
in
america
today
bigger
than
they
were—significantli
bigger
than
when
we
bail
them
out
becaus
they
were
too
big
to
fail
I
think
if
teddi
roosevelt
were
aliv
today
a
good
republican
by
the
way
what
he
would
say
is:
break
them
up;
they
are
too
power
economically;
they
are
too
power
polit
and
that
is
what
I
believ
and
mani
economist
believ
time
to
break
them
up
[applause]
she
ha
had
more
peopl
prais
her
plan
than
your
thank
you
both
let
me
move
on
to
our
next
question
here
and
in
fact
it
come
to
us
through
new
england
cabl
new
secretari
clinton
it
address
to
you
and
it
about
thi
issu
of
the
speech
particularli
to
goldman
sach
thi
is
what
the
question
wrote
verbatim
"I
am
concern
with
the
abus
of
wall
street
ha
taken
with
the
american
taxpay
money"
and
then
she
ask
whether
you
would
releas
the
transcript
of
your
goldman
sach
speech
and
then
ad
"do
not
you
think
the
vote
public
ha
a
right
to
know
what
wa
said?"
but
let u
make
that
bigger
are
you
will
to
releas
the
transcript
of
all
your
paid
speeches?
We
do
know
through
report
that
there
were
transcript
servic
for
all
of
those
paid
speech
In
full
disclosur
would
you
releas
all
of
them?
senat
you
sound
like
you
want
to
respond
Go
ahead
yeah
I
do
I
agre
with
much
of
what
the
secretari
said
but
madam
secretari
it
is
not
one
streak
wall
street
is
an
entiti
of
unbeliev
econom
and
polit
power
that
a
fact
and
I
want
to
say
someth
and
it
may
sound
harsh
not
to
you
but
to
the
american
peopl
In
a
sens
in
my
view
the
busi
model
of
wall
street
is
fraud
it
fraud
I
believ
that
corrupt
is
rampant
and
the
fact
that
major
bank
after
major
bank
ha
reach
multi
billion
dollar
settlement
with
the
unit
state
govern
when
we
have
a
weak
regul
system
tell
me
that
not
onli
did
we
have
to
bail
them
out
onc
if
we
do
not
start
break
them
up
we
are
go
to
have
to
bail
them
out
again
and
I
do
not
want
to
see
that
happen
senat
sander
let
me
turn
to
I
think
where
thi
direct
is
head
anyway
which
is
the
broader
issu
of
big
busi
and
power
in
our
polit
system
you
on
the
campaign
trail
have
rail
against
big
name
american
corpor
like
boe
and
gener
electr
and
wal
mart
but
some
big
busi
in
thi
countri
have
also
been
part
of
advanc
progress
goal
like
that
nationwid
initi
to
expand
employ
opportun
for
veteran
that
wa
all
about
cooper
between
the
obama
administr
and
some
veri
big
busi
the
afford
care
act
some
of
the
thorniest
problem
in
that
bill
were
work
out
in
cooper
with
big
busi
in
order
to
accomplish
progress
goal
could
you
work
with
them
or
have
you
made
enemi
of
big
busi
in
thi
countri
with
the
way
you
have
approach
them
in
thi
campaign?
welcom
back—welcom
back
to
the
democrat
candid
debat
We
are
go
to
be
talk
about
america
in
the
world
both
in
term
of
some
trade
issu
but
also
nation
secur
and
secretari
clinton
we
are
go
to
start
with
you
there
are
more
than
4,000
american
troop
back
in
iraq
right
now
as
part
of
the
fight
against
isi
It
ha
been
15
straight
year
of
war
and
multipl
deploy
for
america
militari
famili
who
have
born
such
a
disproportion
burden
Is
presid
obama
right
to
keep
escal
the
number
of
US
troop
that
fight
isi
right
now?
To
be
clear
to
the
specif
question
if
that
strateg
goal
that
you
are
describ
requir
consider
more
of
americans—an
ever-increas
number
of
american
in
iraq
and
mayb
in
syria

30
seconds:
how
long
are
these
troop
go
to
be
in
afghanistan?
We
have
more
american
troop
in
afghanistan
than
what
we
were
talk
about
with
iraq
you
know
senat
sander
nobodi
know
who
your
foreign
polici
advis
are
you
have
not
given
a
major
foreign
polici
speech
and
it
doe
not
sound
like
all
the
time
that
foreign
polici
is
a
prioriti
other
than
when
you
are
ask
about
it
and
you
say
you
are
go
to
crush
isi
as
you
said
last
night
and
earlier
you
have
not
proactiv
laid
out
a
foreign
polici
doctrin
yet
why?
well
that
not
quit
accur
I
did
give
a
speech
at
georgetown
where
I
talk
about
democrat
social
and
foreign
polici
mayb
I
should
not
have
combin
the
two
in
the
same
speech
becaus
the
foreign
polici
part
of
it
did
not
get
much
attent
So
let
me
take
thi
opportun
to
give
you
a
veri
short
speech
here
on
the
issu
I
think
while
it
is
true
that
the
secretari
and
I
vote
differ
on
the
war
in
iraq
what
is
import
is
that
we
learn
the
lesson
of
the
war
in
iraq
and
that
lesson
is
intrins
to
my
foreign
polici
if
elect
presid
is
the
unit
state
cannot
do
it
alon
We
cannot
be
the
policeman
of
the
world
We
are
now
spend
more
I
believ
than
the
next
eight
countri
on
defens
We
have
got
to
work
in
strong
coalit
with
the
major
power
of
the
world
and
with
those
muslim
countri
that
are
prepar
to
stand
up
and
take
on
terror
So
I
would
say
that
the
key
doctrin
of
the
sander
administr
would
be
no
we
cannot
continu
to
do
it
alone;
we
need
to
work
in
coalit

onc
again
back
in

when
we

about
the

of
the

one

just
add
that
you

I
have
said
thi
befor
and
i am
veri
proud
of
it
that
when
it
come
to
judgment
have
run
a
hard
race
against
senat

at
the
time
he
turn
to
me
to
be
secretari

and
when
it
come
to
the
biggest
counterterror
issu
that
we
face
in
thi
administr
name
whether

not
to
go
after

I
wa
at

exercis
my
judgment
to
advis
the

on
what
to
do
on
that
on
iran
on
russia
on
china
on
a
whole
raft
of
issu
becaus
I
know
from
my
own
experi
that
you
have
got
to
be
readi
on
day
one
there
is
just
too
much
unpredict
threat
and
danger
in
the
world
today
you
know
to
tri
to
just
say
wait
I
will
get
to
that
when
I
can
that
is
just
not
an

secretari

at

the
last

debat
in

want
to

call
for
move
as
aggress
as
we
can
to

your

ha

him
for

that
now
that
he
stand
next
to
you
here
on
thi
stage
can
you
explain
whi
the
US
should
not
tri
to
normal
relat
in

in
your
view?
absolut
you
know
I
did
put
togeth
the
coalit
to
impos
sanction
I
actual
start
the
negoti
that
led
to
the
nuclear
agreement
send
some
much
my
closest
aid
to
begin
the
convers
with
the
iranian
i am
veri
pleas
we
got
that
nuclear
agreement
It
put
a
lid
on
the
nuclear
weapon
program
We
have
to
enforc
it
there
have
to
be
consequ
attach
to
it
but
that
is
not
our
onli
problem
with
iran
We
have
to
figur
out
how
to
deal
with
iran
as
the
princip
state
sponsor
of
terror
in
the
world
they
are
destabil
govern
in
the
region
they
continu
to
support
hezbollah
and
hama
in
lebanon
against
israel
A
lot
of
work
that
we
have
do
is
go
to
be
incred
hard
i am
prepar
to
do
that
work
but
I
believ
just
as
I
did
with
impos
the
sanction
you
have
to
get
action
for
action
If
we
were
to
normal
relat
right
now
we
would
remov
one
of
the
biggest
piec
of
leverag
we
have
to
tri
to
influenc
and
chang
iranian
behavior
the
presid
doe
not
think
we
should
I
certainli
do
not
think
we
should
I
believ
we
have
to
take
thi
step
by
step
to
tri
to
reign
in
iranian
aggress
their
support
for
terror
and
the
other
bad
behavior
that
can
come
back
and
haunt
us
who
said
that
think
we
should
normal
relat
with
iran
tomorrow?
I
never
said
that
I
think
we
should
move
forward
as
quickli
as
we
can
and
you
are
right
they
are
a
sponsor
of
terror
around
the
world
and
we
have
to
address
that
but
you
know
a
number
of
year
ago
peopl
were
say
normal
relationship
with
cuba
what
a
bad
and
silli
idea
they
are
communist
they
are
our
enemi
well
guess
what?
chang
ha
come
So
pleas
do
not
suggest
that
I
think
we
normal
relat
with
tehran
tomorrow
We
do
not
but
I
would
like
to
see
us
move
forward
and
hope
some
day
that
will
happen
and
I
would
say
if
I
might
madam
secretary—and
you
can
correct
me
if
i am
wrong
when
you
ran
against
senat
obama
you
thought
him
naiv
becaus
he
thought
it
wa
a
good
idea
to
talk
to
our
enemi
I
think
those
are
exactli
the
peopl
you
have
to
talk
to
and
you
have
to
negoti
with
[applause]

that
not
the
way
it
work
I
think

had
the
right
idea
and
the
bottom
line
is
that
of
cours
there
have

democrat
debat

thi
question
obvious
presid

lot
of
ambiti
stuff

make
choic
and

a
lot
of
heavi
lift
and
he
made
choic
He
did
healthcar
and
it
came
at
the
expens
arguabl
of
immigr
reform
had
he

doe
not
So

three
big
lift
that

immigr
gun
reform
climat
chang
what

the
best
shot
at
get

someth
first
As
you
know
histori
said—show
what
you
pick
first
is
your
best
shot
at
get
and
how
you
priorit
thing
immigr
reform
for
instanc
fell
by
the
waysid
in
the
first
term
becaus
of
thi
secretari
clinton
republican
particularli
in
campaign
year
often
talk
about
which
depart
of
government—which
agenc
of
govern
they
would
get
rid
of
if
they
were
elect
presid
the
epa
the
depart
of
educ
the
commerc
depart
oops—is—i
there
a
depart
of
govern
that
you

get
rid
of?
Or
is

a
whole
new
one
that
you
would
create?
all
right
befor
we
go
I
want
to
ask
each
one
of
these
secretari
clinton
you
have
made
it
clear
when
you
look
at
senat
sander
you
do
not
see
a
presid
but
do
you
see—
but
do
you
see—do
you
see
a
vice
president?
[laughter]
would
you
unit
the
parti
by
tri
to
pick
senat
sander
as
your
run
mate?
senat
would
you
consid
the
secretary?
I
agre
with
what
the
secretari
said
We
should
not
be
get
ahead
of
ourselv
and
as
I
have
said
mani
time
you
know
sometim
in
these
campaign
thing
get
a
littl
bit
out
of
hand
I
happen
to
respect
the
secretari
veri
much
I
hope
it
mutual
and
on
our
worst
day
I
think
it
is
fair
to
say
we
are
100
time
better
than
ani
republican
candid
