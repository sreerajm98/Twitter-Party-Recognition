"I

primarili
becaus
it
not
who
I
am
becaus
I
think
it
beneath
the
offic
that
i am
seek
but
also
becaus
I
do
not
want
to
embarrass
my
kids"
but
in
the
past
week
you
have
mock
Mr
trump
tan
you
have
made
fun
of
hi
spell
you
call
him
a
con
artist
you
suggest
he
wet
himself
backstag
at
the
last
debat
along
with
other
vulgar
joke
and
jab
So
what
happened?
and
we
will
Mr
trump
your
response?
OK
senat
cruz
you
say
that
you
are
the
true
conserv
in
thi
race
but
15
state
have
vote
now
and
you
have
won
onli
four
of
them
you
have
lost
repeatedli
with
what
is
suppos
to
be
your
core
voter
group
includ
evangel
and
conserv
ha
not
your
brand
of
conservat
been
reject
by
an
elector
that
appear
to
be
more
taken
with
Mr
trump
populist
message?
Go
ahead
Mr
trump
Go
ahead
senat
rubio
ye
I
would
just
say
a
coupl
of
thing
there
is
no
doubt
that
donald
ha
done
well
in
these
elect
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
the
number
are
there
here
is
what
the
number
also
say
two-third
of
the
peopl
who
have
cast
a
vote
in
a
republican
primari
or
caucu
have
vote
against
you
they
do
not
want
you
to
be
our
nomine
and
the
reason
whi
is
becaus
we
are
not
go
to
turn
over
the
conserv
movement
or
the
parti
of
lincoln
or
reagan
for
exampl
to
someon
whose
posit
are
not
conserv
To
someon
who
last
week
defend
plan
parenthood
for
30
second
a
debat
stage
To
someon
for
exampl
that
ha
no
idea
on
foreign
—
someon
who
think
the
nuclear
triad
is
a
rock
band
from
the
1980
Oh
yeah
you
are
OK
alright
