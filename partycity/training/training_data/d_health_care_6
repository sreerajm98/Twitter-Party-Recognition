thi
is
a
veri
import
point
in
thi
debat
becaus
I
do
believ
in
univers
coverag
rememb
I
fought
for
it
25
year
ago
I
believ
in
it
and
I
know
that
thank
the
afford
care
act
we
are
now
90
percent
of
univers
coverag
I
will
build
on
the
afford
care
act
I
will
take
it
further
I
will
reduc
the
cost
but
I
just
respect
disagre
between
the
republican

to
repeal
the
first

we
have
ever
had
to

sander
want
to
throw
us
into
a
contenti
debat
over
single-pay
I
think
the
smart
approach
is
build
on
and
protect
the
afford
care
act
make
it
work
reduc
the
cost
