time
We
are
gonna
take
a
turn
now
secretari
clinton
in
hi
final
state
of
the
union
address
presid
obama
said
hi
biggest
regret
wa
hi
inabl
to
bring
the
countri
togeth
If
presid
obama
could
not
do
it
how
will
you?
omalley:
great
question
No
I
think
the
vacuum
wa
creat
by
the
disastr
war
in
iraq
which
I
vigor
oppos
not
onli
did
I
vote
against
it
I
help
lead
the
opposit
and
what
happen
there
is
ye
it
easi
to
get
rid
of
a
two-bit
dictat
like
saddam
hussein
but
there
wa
not
the
kind
of
thought
as
to
what
happen
the
day
after
you
get
him
and
what
kind
of
polit
vacuum
occur
and
who
rise
up?
group
like
isi
So
I
think
that
presid
obama
made
a
promis
to
the
american
peopl
when
he
ran
and
he
said
you
know
what
i am
go
to
do
my
best
to
bring
american
troop
home
and
I
support
what
he
did
our
job
is
to
train
and
provid
militari
support
for
muslim
countri
in
the
area
who
are
prepar
to
take
on
isi
and
one
point
I
want
to
make
here
that
is
not
made
veri
often
you
have
incred
wealthi
countri
in
that
region
countri
like
saudi
arabia
countri
like
qatar
qatar
happen
to
be
the
largest
â€”
wealthiest
countri
per
capita
in
the
world
they
have
got
to
start
put
in
some
skin
in
the
game
and
not
just
ask
the
unit
state
to
do
it
