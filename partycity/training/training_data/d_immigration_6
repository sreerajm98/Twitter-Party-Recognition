So
secretari
I
have
a
question
for
you
In
2003
you
said
on
a
radio
show
specif
it
wa
john
gambl
radio
show
in
new
york
that
you
were
adamantli
against
illeg
immigr
and
that
peopl
have
to
stop
employ
illeg
immigr
your
new
immigr
plan
is
that
you
would
expand
presid
obama
execut
action
and
that
you
would
push
for
legisl
that
would
includ
a
path
to
citizenship
for
undocu
immigr
So
are
you
flip-flop
on
thi
issue?
Or
are
you
pander
to
latino
what
some
would
call
hispandering?
[laughter]
now
senat
sander
in
2007
you
vote
against
immigr
reform
you
now
say
that
it
wa
becaus
the
bill
had
guestwork
provis
which
seem
semi-slaveri
but
back
then
thi
is
what
you
said
to
cnn
lou
dobb
let
listen
[begin

recent
