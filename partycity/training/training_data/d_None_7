secretari
clinton
30
second
and
we
have
to
take
a
break
So
30
second
if
you
can
secretari
clinton?
well
first
of
all
I
am
look
at
your
daughter
and
i am
veri
grate
that
she
is
laugh
and
she
is
on
a
road
to
recoveri
but
it
never
should
have
happen
you
know
on
averag
90
peopl
a
day
are
kill
by
gun
violenc
in
our
countri
I
think
we
have
to
tri
everyth
that
work
to
tri
to
limit
the
number
of
peopl
and
the
kind
of
peopl
who
are
given
access
to
firearm
the
bradi
bill
which
ha
been
in
effect
now
for
about
23
year
ha
kept
more
than
two
million
purchas
from
go
forward
So
we
do
have
to
continu
to
tri
to
work
on
that
becaus
not
everi
killer
will
have
the
same
profil
but
the
comprehens
background
check
close
the
gun
show
loophol
close
the
onlin
loophol
close
what
call
the
charleston
loophol
where
you
get
a
gun
at
the
end
of
three
day
even
if
the
background
check
is
not
complet
which
is
what
the
killer
in
charleston
did
and
then
they
found
out
later
he
should
not
have
gotten
the
gun
when
he
kill
nine
peopl
at
mother
emmanuel
church
I
also
believ
so
strongli
gene
that
give
immun
to
gunmak
and
seller
wa
a
terribl
mistak
[applause]
becaus
it
remov
ani
account
from
the
maker
and
the
seller
and
it
also
disrupt
what
wa
a
veri
promis
legal
theori
to
tri
to
get
maker
to
do
more
to
make
gun
safer
for
exampl
To
tri
to
give
seller
more
account
for
sell
gun
when
they
should
not
have
So
that
is
an
issu
that
senat
sander
and
I
differ
on
I
vote
against
give
them
immun
but
I
think
we
should
veri
serious
move
to
repeal
that
and
go
back
to
make
sure
gun
maker
and
seller
are
like
ani
other
busi
they
can
be
held
account
and
then
I
do
think
we
have
got
to
have
a
public
question:
thank
you
thank
you
I
want
to
go
to
senat
sander
[applause]
senat
sanders?
senat
sander
secretari
clinton
mention
the
so-
call
charleston
loophol
what

is
call
the
charleston
loophol
Is
that
someth
if
you
were
presid
you
would
you
work
to
extend
that
three
day?
So
you
would
want
a
longer

three
day
wait
period?

well
Do
not
let
me
say
thi
senat

vote
for
that
bill
we
both
support
it
and
I
think
it
fair
to
say
we
did
becaus
back
then
there
wa
an
outcri
over
the
rise
crime
rate
and
peopl
from
all
commun
were
ask
that
action
be
taken
now
my
husband
said
at
the
naacp
last
summer
that
it
solv
some
problem
but
it
creat
other
problem
and
I
agre
and
one
of
those
problem
wa
unfortun
a
move
to
expand
the
reason
whi
peopl
would
be
incarcer
not
just
at
the
feder
level
which
is
what
thi
bill
about
but
in

and
local
as
well

that
whi
the

first

that
I
gave

wa
about

howev
what

In
a
speech
about

the
fbi
director
borrow
a
phrase
from
avenu
Q
saying"
everybodi
is
a
littl
racist"
So
on
a
person
front
what
racial
blind
spot
do
you
have?
let
me
go
answer
Mr
mcghee
question
becaus
I
think
it
a
profound
one
I
think
the
most
import
that
happen
to
me
wa
a
combin
of
my
church
and
youth
minist
when
I
wa
a
teenag
insist
that
we
go
in
to
inner-c
chicago
becaus
I
live
in
a
suburb
and
have
exchang
with
kid
in
black
and
hispan
church
It
wa
also
import
for
me
to
be
a
baby-sitt
for
the
children
of
migrant
worker
and
to
learn
more
about
their
live
and
to
hear
Dr
king
speak
in
chicago
when
I
wa
about
14
year
old
that
got
me
think
about
what
I
need
to
do
to
tri
to
fulfil
my
faith
when
I
wa
in
law
school
I
had
the
opportun
to
mead
a
visionari
woman
name
mari
right
adelman
who
work
with
Dr
king
who
wa
the
first
african-american
woman
who
pass
the
mississippi
bar
I
ask
her
for
a
job
and
she
said
she
did
not
have
ani
money
I
wa
work
my
way
through
law
school
and
she
said
if
I
could
get
a
job
and
get
myself
paid
she
would
give
me
a
job
So
I
got
law
student
a
civil
right
research
council
grant
the
first
thing
she
did
wa
send
me
to
look
at
south
carolina
to
investig
juvenil
be
sent
to
adult
jail
the
second
thing
she
did
wa
to
send
me
to
alabama
to
investig
segreg
academi
So
from
that
moment
until
today
I
am
so
grate
for
my
experi
as
a
veri
young
woman
driven
by
my
church
and
my
experi
work
for
the
children
defens

which
have
given
me
some
insight
and
have
lit

well
let
me
just
veri
briefli
tell
you
a
stori
when
I
wa
in
one
of
my
first
year
in
congress
I
went
to
a
meet
downtown
in
washington
DC
and
I
went
there
with
anoth
congressman
an
african-american
congressman
and
then
we
kind
of
separ
dure
the
meet
and
then
I
saw
him
out
later
on
and
he
wa
sit
there
wait
and
I
said
well
let u
go
out
and
get
a
cab
how
come
you
did
not
go
out
and
get
a
cab?
He
said
no
I
do
not
get
cab
in
washington
DC
thi
wa
20
year
ago
becaus
he
wa
humili
by
the
fact
that
cabdriv
would
go
past
him
becaus
he
wa
black
I
could
not
believ
you
know
you
just
sit
there
and
you
say
thi
man
did
not
take
a
cab
20
year
ago
in
washington
DC
tell
you
anoth
stori
I
wa
with
young
peopl
activ
in
the
black
live
matter
movement
A
young
ladi
come
up
to
me
and
she
say
you
do
not
understand
what
polic
do
in
certain
black
commun
you
do
not
understand
the
degre
to
which
we
are
terror
and
i am
not
just
talk
about
the
horribl
shoot
that
we
have
seen
which
have
got
to
end
and
we
have
got
to
hold
polic
offic
account
i am
just
talk
about
everi
day
activ
where
polic
offic
are
bulli
peopl
So
to
answer
your
question
I
would
say
and
I
think
it
similar
to
what
the
secretari
said
when
you
are
white
you
do
not
know
what
it
like
to
be
live
in
a

you
do
not
know
what
it
like
to
be

you
do
not
know
what
it
like
to
be
hassl
when
you
walk
down
the
street
or
you
get
drag
out
of
a
car
and
I
believ
that
as
a
nation
in
the
year
2016
we
must
be
firm
in
make
it
clear
We
will
end
institut

straight
that

lot
of
provis

strip
out
by

I
disagre

I
have
a

clear

of
idea
about
what
should
be
done
to
tri
to
provid
more
support
includ
tri
to
cut

if
we
are
go
to
talk
about
the
90
let u
talk
about
23
million
new
job
incom
went
up
for
everybodi
the
median
african-
american
incom
went
up
33
percent

we
lift
more
peopl
out

thank
you
veri
much
secretari
I
want
to
turn
now
from
the
state
of
our
nation
school
to
the
state
of
our
nation
crumbl
infrastructur
which
you
talk
a
littl
bit
about
in
the
begin
of
thi
debat
but
beyond
the
detroit
school
and
flint
water
crisis;
pipe
road
and
bridg
are
in
need
of
repair
It
would
take
trillion
of
dollar
to
fix
it
all
senat
sander
ha
propos
a
one
trillion
dollar
plan
but
your
is
onli
a
quarter
of
that
is
your
plan
big
enough
to
fix
the
crumbl
infrastructur
in
thi
country?
well
there
no
doubt
we
have
an
enorm
backlog
of
infrastructur
repair
here
what
Id
do
-
the
congress
final
got
around
to
pass
the
highway
transport
bill
which
should
never
have
been
partisan
-
it
turn
into
be
one
partisan
argument
I
want
to
go
further
I
want
to
put
250
billion
dollar
addit
on
top
of
what
congress
ha
done
that
get
us
to
a
half
a
billion
I
want
to
start
a
nation
infrastructur
bank
I
want
to
capit
it
with
25
billion
that
I
believ
will
leverag
10
time
that
that
anoth
250
billion
So
i am
tri
to
do
thi
in
a
way
that
will
gain
support
and
be
afford
but
there
no
doubt
we
have
to
do
more
on
our
road
our
bridg
our
tunnel
our
port
our
airport
and
as
we
have
talk
in
the
begin
here
under
our
ground
our
water
system
our
sewer
system
We
have
pipelin
that
are
leak
and
that
are
danger
We
have
so
much
work
to
be
done
and
if
we
can
put
million
of
peopl
to
work
I
think
my
plan
is
a
veri
good
way
to
begin
do
that
work
and
get
peopl
out
there
do
it
