find
out
our
ident
as
a
parti
and
as
a

thirty-six
year

revolut
for

gener
they
defin
conservat
as

now
we

blitzer:
thank
you
veri
much
it
now
time
to
begin
question
voter
in
the
first
four
state
have
spoken
and
Mr
trump
ha
emerg
as
the
frontrunn
but
in
five
day
the
candid
will
face
their
biggest
test
yet
super
tuesday
when
nearli
half
of
the
deleg
need
to
win
the
republican
nomin
will
be
award
and
the
biggest
prize
of
the
night
is
texa
immigr
is
a
key
issu
in
thi
state
for
all
voter
nationwid
includ
the
mani
peopl
watch
us
on
telemundo
So
that
where
we
begin
Mr
trump
you
have
call
for
a
deport
forc
to
remov
the
11
million
undocu
immigr
from
the
unit
state
you
have
also
promis
to
let
what
you
call
"the
good
ones"
come
back
in
your
word
"the
good
ones"
after
they
have
been
deport
senat
cruz
would
not
allow
them
to
come
back
in
He
say
that
the
biggest
differ
between
the
two
of
you
He
call
your
plan
amnesti
Is
it?
you
know
the
peopl
that
get
forgotten
in
thi
debat
over
immigr
are
the
hardwork
men
and
women
of
thi
countri
—
our
million
of
american
who
are
lose
their
job
million
of
legal
immigr
who
are
lose
their
job
are
see
their
wage
driven
down
you
know
in
the
past
coupl
of
week
the
wall
street
journal
had
a
veri
interest
articl
about
the
state
of
arizona
arizona
put
in
veri
tough
law
on
illeg
immigr
and
the
result
wa
illeg
immigr
fled
the
state
and
what
happen
there
—
it
wa
a
veri
interest
articl
some
of
the
busi
owner
complain
that
the
wage
they
had
to
pay
worker
went
up
and
from
their
perspect
that
wa
a
bad
thing
but
what
the
state
of
arizona
ha
seen
is
the
dollar
they
are
spend
on
welfar
on
prison
and
educ
all
of
those
have
drop
by
hundr
of
million
of
dollar
and
the
american
and
for
that
matter
the
legal
immigr
who
are
in
arizona
are
see
unemploy
drop
are
see
wage
rise
that
who
we
need
to
be
fight
for
listen
we
have
alway
welcom
legal
immigr
but
I
think
it
is
a
mistak
to
forgiv
those
who
break
the
law
to
allow
them
to
becom
US
citizen
and
that
whi
I
have
led
the
fight
against
grant
citizenship
to
those
here
illeg
and
that
whi
I
will
do
the
same
thing
as
presid
[applause]
blitzer:
Mr
trump
do
you
want
to
respond
to
that?
well
i am
veri
glad
that
ted
mention
arizona
becaus
probabl
the
toughest
man
on
border
is
sheriff
joe
arpaio
and
two
day
ago
he
total
endors
me
so
thank
you
[applause]
blitzer:
senat
rubio?
senat
cruz
ha
call
your
immigr
plan
amnesti
and
ha
an
add
out
there
compar
it
to
presid
obama
He
say
both
of
you
support
allow
undocu
immigr
legal
statu
here
in
the
unit
state
after
a
background
check
pay
a
fine
and
pay
tax
are
those
claim
correct?
well
first
of
all
and
befor
we
do
anyth
I
have
been
abundantli
clear
on
thi
when
i am
presid
of
the
unit
state
befor
we
do
anyth
on
immigr
we
are
go
to
secur
the
border
and
that
not
just
the
physic
border
with
mexico
it
visa
overstay
that
45
percent
of
the
problem
right
there
It
also
ha
to
do
—
that
whi
we
need
e-verifi
and
entry-exit
track
system
and
so-forth
and
until
that
happen
we
are
not
do
anyth
els
and
then
we
will
see
what
the
american
peopl
are
will
to
support
and
donald
mention
becaus
he
mention
me
in
hi
answer
that
hi
posit
on
immigr
is
what
ha
driven
thi
debat
well
the
truth
is
though
that
a
lot
of
these
posit
that
he
now
take
are
new
to
him
In
2011
he
talk
about
the
need
for
a
pathway
to
citizenship
In
2012
donald
critic
mitt
romney
say
that
mitt
lost
hi
elect
becaus
of
self-deport
and
so
even
today
we
saw
a
report
in
one
of
the
newspap
that
donald
you
have
hire
a
signific
number
of
peopl
from
other
countri
to
take
job
that
american
could
have
fill
My
mom
and
dad
—
my
mom
wa
a
maid
at
a
hotel
and
instead
of
hire
an
american
like
her
you
have
brought
in
over
a
thousand
peopl
from
all
over
the
world
to
fill
those
job
instead
So
I
think
thi
is
an
import
issu
and
I
think
we
are
realiz
increasingli
that
it
an
import
issu
for
the
countri
that
ha
been
debat
for
30
year
but
final
need
to
be
solv
onc
and
for
all
blitzer:
Mr
trump?
well
first
of
all
self-deport
is
peopl
are
go
to
leav
as
soon
as
they
see
other
go
out
If
you
look
at
dwight
eisenhow
in
the
1950
they
start
move
peopl
out
and
the
rest
of
them
left
self-deport
as
I
realli
defin
it
and
that
the
way
I
defin
it
is
you
are
go
to
get
some
to
go
and
the
rest
are
go
to
go
out
As
far
as
the
peopl
that
I
have
hire
in
variou
part
of
florida
dure
the
absolut
prime
season
like
palm
beach
and
other
locat
you
could
not
get
help
it
the
up
season
peopl
did
not
want
to
have
part-tim
job
there
were
part-tim
job
veri
season
90-day
job
120-day
job
and
you
could
not
get
everybodi
agre
with
me
on
that
they
were
part-tim
job
you
need
them
or
we
just
might
as
well
close
the
door
becaus
you
could
not
get
help
in
those
hot
hot
section
of
florida
that
—
my
point
that
I
made
wa
you
had
critic
mitt
romney
for
self-deport
you
said
that
hi
strategi
of
self-
deport
is
whi
he
lost
the
elect
and
I
think
peopl
in
florida
would
be
surpris
becaus
in
fact
the
articl
that
wa
today
they
interview
a
number
of
peopl
that
would
have
been
will
to
do
those
job
if
you
would
have
been
will
to
hire
them
to
do
it
I
critic
mitt
romney
for
lose
the
elect
He
should
have
won
that
elect
He
had
a
fail
presid
He
ran
a
terribl
campaign
He
wa
a
terribl
candid
that
what
I
critic
mitt
romney
—
I
mean
ran
No
he
excus
me
He
ran
one
terribl
campaign
that
an
elect
that
should
have
been
won
[applause]
well
in
fact
I
agre
we
should
have
won
and
I
wish
we
would
have
but
in
fact
you
did
critic
him
for
use
the
term
self-deport
I
mean
that
on
the
record
and
peopl
can
look
it
up
right
now
onlin
but
again
I
just
want
to
reiter
I
think
it
realli
import
thi
point
I
think
it
fine
it
an
import
point
that
you
rais
and
we
discuss
on
immigr
thi
is
a
big
issu
for
texa
a
huge
issu
for
the
countri
but
I
also
think
that
if
you
are
go
to
claim
that
you
are
the
onli
one
that
lift
thi
into
the
campaign
that
you
acknowledg
that
for
exampl
you
are
onli
person
on
thi
stage
that
ha
ever
been
fine
for
hire
peopl
to
work
on
your
project
illeg
you
hire
some
worker
from
poland
No
no
i am
the
onli
one
on
the
stage
that
hire
peopl
you
have
not
hire
anybodi
[applause]
In
fact
some
of
the
peopl
[crosstalk]
and
by
the
way
I
have
hire
—
and
by
the
way
I
have
hire
ten
of
thousand
of
peopl
over
at
my
job
you
have
hire
nobodi
ye
you
have
hire
a
thousand
from
anoth
countri
you
have
had
noth
but
problem
with
your
credit
card
et
cetera
So
do
not
tell
me
about
that
let
me
just
say
—
let
me
finish
the
statement
thi
is
import
you
have
not
hire
one
person
you
liar
He
hire
worker
from
poland
and
he
had
to
pay
a
million
dollar
or
so
in
a
judgment
from
that
wrong
that
wrong
total
wrong
that
a
fact
peopl
can
look
it
up
i am
sure
peopl
are
googl
it
right
now
look
it
up
"trump
polish
workers"
you
will
see
a
million
dollar
for
hire
illeg
worker
on
one
of
hi
project
He
did
it
[applause]
that
happen
I
have
hire
ten
of
thousand
of
peopl
over
my
lifetim
ten
of
thousand
mani
from
other
countri
instead
of
hire
american
Be
quiet
just
be
quiet
[applause]
let
me
talk
I
have
hire
ten
of
thousand
of
peopl
He
bring
up

senat
cruz
you
say
you
want
to
deport
the
11
million
undocu
immigr
but
you
never
want
to
allow
them
to
come
back
to
the
unit
state
what
would
happen
to
the
children
who
are
us-
born
citizen
whose
parent
will
be
deport
under
your
plan?
well
exist
law
provid
that
those
who
are
deport
cannot
come
back
here
legal
US
citizen
can
come
back
that
exist
law
but
let
me
say
wolf
I
realli
find
it
amaz
that
donald
believ
that
he
is
the
one
who
discov
the
issu
of
illeg
immigr
I
can
tell
you
when
I
ran
for
senat
here
in
the
state
of
texa
I
ran
promis
to
lead
the
fight
against
amnesti
promis
to
fight
to
build
a
wall
and
in
2013
when
I
wa
fight
against
the
"gang
of
eight"
amnesti
bill
where
wa
donald?
He
wa
fire
denni
rodman
on
"celebr
apprentice"
[laughter]
and
inde
if
you
look
at
the
"gang
of
eight"
one
individu
on
thi
stage
broke
hi
promis
to
the
men
and
women
who
elect
him
and
wrote
the
amnesti
bill
If
you
look
at
the
eight
member
of
the
gang
of
eight
donald
gave
over
$50000
to
three
democrat
and
two
republican
and
when
you
are
fund
open
border
politician
you
should
not
be
surpris
when
they
fight
for
open
border
and
I
think
if
you
want
to
know
who
actual
will
secur
the
border
and
follow
through
you
ought
to
ask
who
ha
a
record
befor
they
were
a
candid
for
presid
of
fight
to
secur
the
border
and
stop
amnesti
and
i am
the
onli
one
on
thi
stage
that
ha
that
record
and
by
the
way
marco
is
exactli
right
that
a
feder
court
found
donald
guilti
of
be
part
of
a
conspiraci
to
hire
peopl
illeg
and
enter
a
$1
million
judgment
against
him
[applause]
blitzer:

and
they
are
pack
with

I
have
had
an
amaz
relationship
with

As

everi

of

republican
senat
back

you
do
not

[applause]

He

anyon

you

cronyism
let u
actual
stand

of
thi
countri
washington
doe

and
donald
if

not
a
good
attribut
for
a

[applause]
[crosstalk]

He

On
hi
financi
disclosur
form
he
did
not
even
put
that
he
borrow
money
from
citibank
and
from
goldman
sach
which
is
a
total
violat
He
did
not
talk
about
the
fact
that
he
pay
almost
no
interest
He
just
left
it
off
and
now
he
go
to
protect
the
peopl
from
the
big
bad
bank
give
me
a
break
blitzer:
all
right
We
are
go
to
move
on
to
governor
kasich
governor
kasich
[crosstalk]
wolf
can
I
respond
to
that
attack?
blitzer:
you
can
respond
but
let
me
get
governor
kasich
in
he
been
wait
patient
governor
kasich
the
idea
—
you
have
said
thi
and
I
want
to
quot
you
now:
"the
idea
that
we
are
go
to
deport
all
these
peopl
is
ludicr
and
everybodi
know
it"
those
are
your
word
should
peopl
be
allow
to
break
the
law
just
becaus
it
not
feasibl
to
stop
them?
look
we
have
a
great
presid
here
georg
bush
the
41st
presid
of
the
unit
state
He
work
with
ronald
reagan
to
pass
an
effort
to
tri
to
solv
thi
problem
—
a
path
to
legal
you
see
that
wa
a
time
when
thing
work
It
wa
a
time
when
presid
reagan
and
georg
bush
decid
that
we
need
to
make
the
countri
work
look
I
think
there
is
an
answer
here
the
answer
is
you
complet
the
border
you
let
peopl
know
that
onc
it
done
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
come
in
If
you
come
in
we
do
not
want
ani
excus
you
are
go
to
go
back
but
I
favor
a
guest
worker
program
I
think
it
practic
and
I
think
for
the
11
million
or
115
million
american
—
the
illeg
that
are
here
if
they
have
not
commit
a
crime
sinc
they
have
been
here
Id
make
them
pay
a
fine
some
back
tax
mayb
some
commun
servic
and
at
the
end
Id
give
them
a
path
to
legal
but
not
a
path
to
citizenship
I
do
not
think
we
are
go
to
tear
famili
apart
I
do
not
think
we
are
go
to
ride
around
in
peopl
neighborhood
and
grab
peopl
out
of
their
home
I
do
not
think
—
first
of
all
I
do
not
think
it
practic
and
I
do
not
think
it
reflect
america
you
know
what
happened?
the
problem
with
presid
reagan
is
we
did
not
get
in
there
and
actual
finish
the
border
and
I
think
it
wa
probabl
busi
interest
that
affect
it
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
let u
be
practic
let
start
solv
problem
in
thi
countri
instead
of
kick
them
upstair
with
presid
reagan
and
georg
bush
it
wa
a
bipartisan
coalit
to
address
the
issu
and
I
think
we
can
and
should
do
it
again
and
I
will
have
a
plan
in
the
first
100
day
to
get
it
done
and
get
thi
issu
behind
us
[applause]
blitzer:
thank
you
governor
[applause]
Dr
carson
you
have
been
critic
of
mass
deport
you
said
back
in
novemb
you
do
not
think
Mr
trump
plan
necessarili
repres
the
republican
parti
given
how
well
Mr
trump
ha
been
do
with
the
republican
primari
voter
do
you
still
believ
that?
I
believ
in
liberti
and
justic
for
all
I
think
everyth
that
we
do
should
be
fair
and
I
have
alreadi
describ
—
you
know
how
we
can
secur
the
border
We
need
to
secur
all
the
border
becaus
it
not
just
peopl
come
in
from
south
america
and
mexico
but
there
are
terrorist
who
want
to
destroy
us
who
are
get
across
our
border
fairli
easili
and
we
have
to
stop
that
but
in
term
of
the
peopl
who
are
here
alreadi
after
we
—
after
we
stop
the
illeg
immigr
we
need
to
be
reason
and
I
would
give
them
a
six-month
period
in
which
to
get
regist
as
a
guest
worker
assum
that
they
have
an
accept
record
they
have
to
pay
a
back-tax
penalti
have
to
pay
tax
go
forward
but
they
do
not
have
to
live
underground
anymor
and
I
think
they
do
not
becom
american
citizen
they
do
not
vote
If
they
want
to
becom
an
american
citizen
they
go
through
exactli
the
same
process
that
anybodi
els
goe
through
I
think
that
the
kind
of
situat
that
is
actual
fair
to
peopl
and
we
have
other
way
of
—
of
util
our
facil
and
our
talent
as
foreign
aid:
do
thing
in
south
america
and
central
america
and
mexico
that
improv
the
economi
there
so
that
they
do
not
feel
the
need
to
come
over
here
that
would
cost
us
a
lot
less
than
borrow
money
from
china
pay
interest
on
it
blitzer:
thank
you
Dr
carson
[applause]
Mr
trump
your
campaign
as
you
well
rememb
began
with
the
idea
of
build
a
wall
along
the
southern
border
[inaudible]
blitzer:
it
about
315
mile
southwest
of
where
we
are
right
now
you
have
said
the
mexican
govern
will
pay
for
it
correct
blitzer:
the
spokesperson
for
the
current
presid
of
mexico
say
that
will
never
happen
the
last
two
presid
of
mexico
say
that
will
never
happen
In
fact
the
former
presid
of
mexico
vicent
fox

and
i am
quot
him
—
he
said
"im

"ef

So
if
you

not
get
an
actual
check
from
the
mexican
govern
for
$8
billion
or
$10
billion
or
$12
billion
whatev
it
will
cost
how
are
you
go
to
make
them
pay
for
the

I
will
and
the

I
saw
him

the
statement
I
saw
him
use
the
word
that
he
use
I
can
onli
tell
you
if
I
would
have
use
even
half
of
that
word
it
would
have
been
nation
scandal
thi
guy
use
a
filthi
disgust

he

the
wall
is
$10
billion

1,000
mile
the
great
wall
of
china
built
2,000
year
ago
—
2,000,
is
13,000
mile
We
need
1,000,
becaus
we

of
natur
barrier
We

to
$12

if
they

it
a
small
portion
of
the
kind
of

In

that
is
how

how

well
maria
I
would
note
you
made
the
exact
same
point
here
that
I
made
at
the
last
debat
and
you
are
right
that
senat
rubio
call
me
a
liar
for
say
that
you
know
we
have
both
seen
at
home
when
washington
politician
say
about
an
illeg
or
unconstitut
program
well
it
will
have
to
end
some
day
not
immedi
but
someday
in
the
futur
that
inevit
is
when
a
politician
doe
not
plan
to
end
it
at
all
you
know
i am
remind
of
that
that
is
the
same
posit
that
marco
took
in
iowa
on
ethanol
subsidi
when
I
campaign
in
iowa
I
took
on
the
lobbyist
took
on
the
corpor
welfar
and
said
we
should
have
no
ethanol
subsidi
marco
posit
wa
the
same
as
it
is
to
illeg
amnesti
well
someday
it
should
end
just
not
now
and
frankli
I
think
we
need
a
presid
who
know
what
he
believ
in
is
will
to
say
it
on
day
one
not
at
the
end
of
hi
term
when
it
somebodi
els
problem
that
not
an
accur
assess
of
what
I
said
about
ethanol
what
I
said
is
that
ethanol
will
phase
out
it
is
phase
out
now
By
2022
that
program
expir
by
virtu
of
the
exist
law
and
at
that
point
it
will
go
away
I
do
not
agre
with
the
mandat
and
the
program
that
in
place
but
I
think
it
unfair
that
these
peopl
have
gone
out
and
invest
all
thi
money
into
thi
program
and
we
are
just
go
to
yank
it
away
from
them
and
again
you
read
the
statement
in
spanish
I
said
veri
clearli
on
spanish
televis
daca
will
have
to
end
at
some
point
and
that
point
is
—
at
that
time
I
wa
not
a
candid
for
presid
I
said
it
will
end
in
my
first

in

the
peopl
who
have
it
now
will
not

is
the

senat
cruz
you
and
senat
rubio
are
the
two
candid
of
hispan
descent
on
thi
stage
As
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
the
first
hispan
candid
ever
to
win
a
caucu
or
primari
[applause]
and
yet
there
is
the
percept
in
the
latino
commun
that
instead
of
tri
to
prove
to
latino
who
ha
the
best
plan
the
best
platform
to
help
them
that
you
two
are
spend
the
time
argu
with
each
other
tri
to
figur
out
which
one
is
tougher
on
immigr
in
order
to
appeal
to
the
major
of
republican
So
my
question
to
you
is
are
you
miss
a
huge
opportun
to
expand
the
republican
base?
well
maria
you
are
right
It
is
extraordinari
that
of
five
peopl
stand
on
thi
stage
that
two
of
us
are
the
children
of
cuban
immigr
It
realli
is
the
embodi
of
the
incred
opportun
and
promis
thi
nation
provid
you
know
I
would
note
that
a
lot
of
folk
in
the
media
have
a
definit
of
hispan
that
you
can
onli
be
hispan
if
you
are
liber
that
make
sens
in
the
media
but
I
gotta
tell
you
one
of
the
thing
I
wa
most
proud
of
when
I
ran
for
senat
here
in
texa
I
earn
40
percent
of
the
hispan
vote
here
in
texa
At
the
same
time
mitt
romney
wa
get
clobber
with
27
percent
of
the
hispan
vote
nationwid
and
the
reason
is
as
you
know
you
look
at
the
valu
sin
the
hispan
commun
the
valu
in
our
commun
are
faith
famili
patriot
you
know
we
have
got
the
highest
rate
of
militari
enlist
among
hispan
in
ani
demograph
in
thi
countri
and
when
I
campaign
and
I
campaign
the
same
here
in
houston
or
dalla
as
I
did
in
the
rio
grand
valley
defend

in

english
wash

have

and
the
truth
is
the

ha
done
enorm
damag
to
the
hispan

It
is
not
work
in
the
hispan
commun
and
i[bel

so
that
everyon
who
is
struggl
in
the
hispan
commun
and
beyond
will
have
a
fair
and
even
shake
at
the
american
dream
i am
sorri
I
wa
mention
arrarás:
governor

I
wa
mention
in
that
I
wa
mention
in
that
statement
arrarás:
governor
kasich
after
the
OK
I
wa
mention
—
just
becaus
of
the
hispan
—
and
I
will
be
brief
A
coupl
point
number
one
I
do
think
it
amaz
that
on
thi
stage
tonight
there
are
two
descend
of
cuban
origin
and
an
african
american
We
are
the
parti
of
divers
not
the
democrat
parti
[cheer
and
applause]
and
the
second
point
I
would
make
is
that
we
have
to
move
past
thi
idea
that
somehow
the
hispan
commun
onli
care
about
immigr
ye
it
an
import
issu
becaus
we
know
and
love
peopl
that
have
been
impact
by
it
but
i am
go
to
tell
you
that
the
most
power
sentiment
in
the
hispan
commun
as
it
is
in
everi
immigr
commun
is
the
burn
desir
to
leav
your
children
better
off
than
yourself[bel
ringing]and
you
can
onli
do
that
through
free
enterpris
that
what
we
stand
for
not
social
like
berni
sander
and
increasingli
hillari
clinton
[applause]
arrarás:
governor
kasich
after
the
last
presidenti
elect
the
republican
parti
realiz
that
in
order
to
win
the
presid
it
need
the
support
of
latino
guidelin
as
to
how
to
accomplish
that
were
spell
out
in
an
autopsi
report
that
conclud
and
i am
go
to
quot
it
"if
hispan
american
hear
that
the
gop
doe
not
want
them
in
the
unit
state
they
will not
pay

next
sentence"
So
do
you
think
that
your
fellow
republican
candid
get
it?
well
i am
not
go
to
talk
about
that
I
mean
I
have
got
to
tell
you
I
wa
with
thi
littl
12-year-old

and
she
said
you

I
do
not

thi

and
scream
at
the
debat
My
mother
think
I
might
not
be
abl
to
watch
the
thing
anymor
I
think
we
ought
to
move
beyond
that
about
what
they
think
i am
go
to
tell
you
what
I
think
My
posit
on
thi
whole
immigr
issu
ha
been
clear
from
the
begin
I
have
not
chang
anyth
with
it
and
look
my
view
is
we
need
econom
growth
everyth
start
with
econom
growth
and
how
do
you
get
it?
common
sens
regul
lower
tax
for
both
busi
and
individu
and
of
cours
a
fiscal
plan
that
balanc
the
budget
that
give
you
econom
growth
I
did
it
when
I
wa
in

as
the

committe
chairman
negoti
actual
with
democrat
that
gave
us
surplus
econom
growth
and
the
same
thing
in

but
here
the
thing
that
I
believ
econom
growth
is
not
an
end
unto
itself
We
have
to
make
sure
that
everybodi
ha
a
sens
that
they
can
rise
Of
cours
our

in

our
friend
in

the
promis
of

is
that
our
system
when
we
follow

go

what?
with
me
and
the
hispan
commun
I
think
they
like
me
and
I
appreci
that
becaus
I
want
them
to
have
the
same
opportun
that
I
and
my

and

we

have

thi
recommend

are
you
as

get

I
did
not
hear
the
first
part
of
the
question?
arrarás:
the
first
part
of
the
question
is
there
wa
a
report
that
recommend
that
in
order
to
approach
hispan
and
bring
them
to
vote
for
the
republican
parti
certain
thing
need
to
happen
and
one
of
them
wa
that
they
should
not
feel
like
they
were
go
to
get
kick
out
of
the
unit
state
otherwis
they
would
not
pay
attent
to
one
more
sentenc
from
candid
OK
well
first
of
all
let
me
just
mention
that
last
year
at
the
naleo
the
nation
associ
for
latino
elect
offici
I
wa
the
onli
one
of
17
republican
candid
to
go
there
and
the
reason
that
I
do
not
fear
go
to
an
organ
like
that
is
becaus
the
messag
that
I
give
is
the
same
messag
to
everi
group
you
know
thi
is
america
and
we
need
to
have
polici
that
are
—
that
give
liberti
and
justic
to
all
peopl
and
that
the
way
that
I
have
fashion
virtual
everi
polici
look
at
that
and
I
think
that
the
way
the
republican
parti
gener
think
We
do
not
pick
and
choos
winner
and
loser
We
are
compassion
but
real
compass
is
provid
peopl
with
a
ladder
of
opportun
to
climb
up
from
a
state
of
depend
and
becom
part
of
the
fabric
of

when
we
begin
to
emphas
that
I

you

when
you

crazi

are
you
talk

crazi
zealot
—
give
me
a
break
hewitt:
senat
rubio
you
have
heard
thi
exchang
on
religi
liberti
you
have
said
that
religi
liberti
will
trump
even
the
abil
of
peopl
to
stay
away
from
same-sex
marriag
not
provid
flower
not
provid
bake
good
et
cetera
are
you
satisfi
with
thi
exchang
on
religi
liberty?
well
I
think
you
ask
a
veri
import
question
becaus
the
issu
here
—
the
next
presid
of
the
unit
state
ha
to
fill
thi
vacanc
justic
scalia
—
in
the
histori
of
the
republ
there
ha
never
been
anyon
better
than
him
at
stand
for
the
principl
that
the
constitut
is
not
a
live
and
breath
document
—
it
is
suppos
to
be
appli
as
origin
meant
and
the
next
presid
of
the
unit
state
ha
to
be
someon
that
you
can
trust
and
believ
in
to
appoint
someon
just
as
good
as
scalia
—
plu
there
may
be
at
least
two
other
vacanc
So
you
ask
Mr
trump
to
respond
and
say
that
he
would
and
he
say
that
he
would
but
the
bottom
line
is
if
you
look
at
hi
record
over
the
last
25
or
30
year
on
issu
after
issu
he
ha
not
been
on
our
side
now
if
he
chang
we
are
alway
look
for
convert
into
the
conserv
movement
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
if
you
do
not
have
a
record
there
to
look
at
and
say
"I
feel
at
peac
that
when
donald
trump
is
presid
of
the
unit
state
he
go
to
be
firmli
on
our
side
on
these
issues"
In
fact
veri
recent
he
wa
still
defend
plan
parenthood
He
say
he
not
go
to
take
side
in
the
palestinian
versu
israel
these
are
concern
thing
and
so
ye
I
have
a
doubt
about
whether
donald
trump
if
he
becom
presid
will
replac
justic
scalia
with
someon
just
like
justic
scalia
hewitt:
Mr
trump?
[applause]
well
let
—
let
me
just
say
—
let
me
just
say
first
of
all
I
have
great
respect
for
justic
scalia
I
thought
he
wa
terrif
and
if
you
talk
about
evolv
ronald
reagan
wa
a
somewhat
liber
democrat
ronald
reagan
evolv
into
a
somewhat
strong
conserv
—
more
importantli
he
wa
a
great
presid
A
great
presid
As
far
as
plan
parenthood
is
concern
i am
pro-lif
i am
total
against
abort
have
to
do
with
plan
parenthood
but
million
and
million
of
women
—
cervic
cancer
breast
cancer
—
are
help
by
plan
parenthood
So
you
can
say
whatev
you
want
but
they
have
million
of
women
go
through
plan
parenthood
that
are
help
greatli
and
I
would
not
fund
it
I
would
defund
it
becaus
of
the
abort
factor
which
they
say
is
3
percent
I
do
not
know
what
percentag
it
is
they
say
it
3
percent
but
I
would
defund
it
becaus
i am
pro-lif
but
million
of
women
are
help
by
plan

when

they
are
in

in

I
would
fight

I

you
would

thank
you
thank
you
both
governor
kasich
you
have
said
it
is
quot
"un
american
to
deni
someon
health
insur
if
they
have
a
preexist
condition"
would
you
leav
the
individu
mandat
in
place
requir
all
american
to
purchas
insurance?
governor
let
me
just
go
back
to
the
origin
question
about
the
individu
mandat
In
1994
when
you
were
in
congress
you
propos
a
plan
requir
an
individu
mandat
So
what
changed?
governor
kasich
thank
you
Dr
carson
you
have
dealt
with
the
sickest
of
patient
you
support
cover
preexist
condit
how
would
you
chang
obamacar
but
maintain
that
coverage?
well
first
of
all
healthcar
is
not
a
right
but
I
do
believ
it
is
a
respons
for
a
respons
societi
and
we
are
that
We
spend
almost
twice
as
much
per
capita
on
healthcar
as
mani
other
nation
who
have
actual
much
better
access
than
we
do
I
propos
a
system
in
which
we
use
health
empower
account
which
are
like
a
health
save
account
with
no
bureaucrat
and
we
give
it
to
everybodi
from
birth
until
death
they
can
pass
it
on
when
they
die
We
pay
for
it
with
the
same
dollar
that
we
pay
for
tradit
healthcar
with
We
give
peopl
the
abil
to
shift
money
within
their
health
empower
account
within
their
famili
So
dad
$500
short
mom
can
give
it
to
him
or
a
cousin
or
uncl
and
it
make
everi
famili
their
own
insur
carrier
with
no
middl
man
It
give
you
enorm
flexibl
and
also
you
know
if
uncl
joe
is
smoke
like
a
chimney
everybodi
go
to
hide
hi
cigarett
becaus
they
are
all
interest
in
what
go
on
there
also
the
—
your
catastroph
healthcar
is
go
to
cost
a
lot
less
money
now
becaus
the
onli
thing
come
out
of
that
is
catastroph
healthcar
So
it
like
a

with

where
you

you
can
buy
the

that
will
take

of
75
percent
of
the

the

who

how
do
we
take

of

medicaid
what
the
medicaid
budget?
almost
$500
billion;
almost
80
million
peopl
particip
which
is
way
too
mani
and
that
will
get
a
lot
better
when
we
fix
the
economi
which
I
hope
we
get
a
chanc
to
talk
about
but
do
the
math
over
$5000
for
each
man
woman
and
child
and
all

they
will
have
a
lot
more

disclosur
form
—
almost
100

you

you

We

obvious
if

As

I

hewitt:
So
senat
rubio
mitt
romney
also
call
upon
to
you
releas
your
tax
return
your
campaign
said
last
spring
that
you
would
releas
your
return
that
you
had
not
previous
releas
and
you
said
come
out
ani
day
momentarili
when
are
we
go
to
see
your
returns?
ye
tomorrow
or
saturday
in
fact
is
our
plan
to
releas
them
and
there
noth
realli
that
interest
in
them
So
I
have
no
problem
releas
them
and
luckili
i am
not
be
audit
thi
year
or
last
year
for
that
matter
[crosstalk]
but
thi
is
my
time
I
want
to
go
back
to
thi
question
you
ask
about
the
debt
thi
is
an
import
issu
it
a
huge
issu
ok?
In
less
than
five
year
83
percent
of
our
entir
budget
will
be
made
up
of
social
secur
medicar
medicaid
and
the
interest
on
the
debt
that
mean
onli
17
percent
of
our
budget
will
be
for
thing
like
the
militari
or
the
depart
of
educ
or
environment
protect
issu
you
cannot
balanc
our
budget
unless
you
deal
with
that
83
percent
which
is
whi
I
have
been
repeatedli
talk
about
sinc
my
time
run
for
the
senat
in
florida
where
there
are
a
lot
of
peopl
like
my
mother
that
depend
on
social
secur
and
medicar
on
the
need
to
save
those
program
by
reform
the
way
they
work
for
futur
gener
and
I
think
if
we
—
the
longer
we
take
to
do
thi
the
closer
we
are
go
to
get
to
a
debt
crisi
and
wolf
you
did
not
get
an
answer
to
your
question
thi
debt
issu
is
—
the
next
presid
of
the
unit
state
will
not
be
abl
to
serv
four
to
eight
year
without
deal
with
the
nation
debt
It
is
not
a
question
of
if
it
is
a
question
of
when
we
have
a
debt
crisi
and
we
should
not
leav
the
stage
here
tonight
without
hear
a
seriou
answer
from
everi
singl
one
of
us
about
how
we
are
go
to
deal
bring
the
nation
debt
under
control
onc
and
for
all
hewitt:
thank
you

If

fals
and
that
an

wa
fraudul
the
voter
need
to
know
and
listen
peopl
across
thi
countri
we
recogn
our
countri
is
in
crisi
the
most
import
question
is
how
do
we
win
the
gener
elect
in
november 2016.
and
roughli
65
percent
of

think
donald

not
the
right
candid
to
go
against
hillari
clinton
now
part
of
the
reason
in

agre
with
hillari
clinton
and
on
which
I
disagre
with
them
both
strongli
both
donald
and
hillari
clinton
want
to
be
neutral
to
use
donald
word
between
israel
and
the
palestinian
let
me
be
clear
If
i am
presid
america
will
stand
unapologet
with
the
nation
of
israel
[applause]
and
the
notion
of
neutral
is
base
upon
the
left
buy
into
thi
moral
relativ
that
is
often
pitch
in
the
media
listen
it
is
not
equival
when
you
have
terrorist
strap
dynamit
around
their
chest
explod
and
murder
innoc
women
and
children
they
are
not
equival
to
the
idf
offic
protect
israel
and
I
will
not
pretend
that
they
are
just
today
iran
announc
they
are
go
to
pay
$7000
to
each
suicid
bomber
and
I
would
note
miss
from
donald
answer
wa
anyth
he
ha
done
in
hi
nearli
70
year
of
live
defend
israel
I
have
over
and
over
again
led
the
fight
to
defend
israel
to
fight
for
israel
and
thi
—
if
you
want
to
know
who
will
stand
with
israel
we
ought
to
start
with
who
ha
stood
with
israel
when
the
heat
wa
on
[applause]
blitzer:
Mr
trump?
well
I
can
onli
say
—
look
I
can
onli
say
I
have
been
a
big
contributor
to
israel
over
the
year
I
have
receiv
mani
mani
award
from
israel
as
I
have
said
befor
I
have
a
great
relationship
with
israel
and
i am
go
to
keep
it
that
way
and
if
I
could
bring
peac
that
would
be
a
fantast
thing
It
would
be
one
of
my
greatest
achiev
as
presid
blitzer:
governor
kasich
I
want
you
to
weigh
in
well
I
mean
well
I
wa
in
congress
for
18
year
on
the
defens
committe
and
then
you
know
after
9/11
the
secretari
of
defens
call
me
in
to
help
out
with
some
thing
and
I
have
been
a
support
of
israel
—
a
strong
support
of
israel
longer
than
anybodi
on
thi
stage
I
did
not
give
as
much
money
as
donald
gave
but
I
have
been
stand
with
the
isra
for
a
veri
long
time
and
frankli
I
think
the
problem
we
have
in
foreign
polici
right
now
wolf
is
that
we
are
not
certain
with
who
we
stand
with
our
alli
are
not
sure
what
to
make
of
us
and
our
enemi
are
move
and
one
—
are
move
becaus
they
are
not
sure
what
we
will
do
it
a
veri
interest
develop
here
within
the
24
hour
We
said
to
the
south
korean
that
we
would
give
them
the
high
altitud
defens
system
It
realli
rattl
the
chines
and
for
the
first
time
sinc
we
took
posit
action
the
chines
are
begin
to
take
action
against
north
korea
when
we
stand
firm
and
we
let
the
world
know
who
we
are
with
who
we
stand
for
and
we
bring
our
alli
togeth
that
is
the
road
forward
[crosstalk]
[applause]
blitzer:
We
are
go
to
get
to
north
korea
in
a
moment
but
senat
rubio
what
wrong
with
the
US
be
an
honest
broker
in
a
negoti
as
Mr
trump
is
proposing?
becaus
—
and
I
do
not
know
if
donald
realiz
thi
i am
sure
it
not
hi
intent
perhap
but
the
posit
you
have
taken
is
an
anti-israel
posit
and
here
whi
becaus
you
cannot
be
an
honest
broker
in
a
disput
between
two
side
in
which
one
of
the
side
is
constantli
act
in
bad
faith
the
palestinian
author
ha
walk
away
from
multipl
effort
to
make
peac
veri
gener
offer
from
the
israel
instead
here
what
the
palestinian
do
they
teach
their
four-
year-old
children
that
kill
jew
is
a
gloriou
thing
here
what
hama
doe
they
launch
rocket
and
terrorist
attack
again
israel
on
an
ongo
basi
the
bottom
line
is
a
deal
between
israel
and
the
palestinian
given
the
current
makeup
of
the
palestinian
is
not
possibl
and
so
the
next
presid
of
the
unit
state
need
to
be
someon
like
me
who
will
stand
firmli
on
the
side
of
israel
i am
not
—
i am
not
go
to
sit
here
and
say
"oh
i am
not
on
either
side"
I
will
be
on
a
side
I
will
be
on
israel
side
everi
singl
day
becaus
they
are
the
onli
pro-american

donald
OK
no
no
no
—
a
deal
is
a
deal
let
me
tell
you
that
I
learn
a
long
time
ago
A

is
not
a

when
you

with

have
you
ever
negoti
with

you
are
not

you

with

you

donald
might
be

palestinian

I
want
to
be
abl
to
bring
peac
blitzer:
senat
He
will
never
be
abl
to
do
it
I
think
I
may
be
abl
to
do
it
although
I
will
say
thi
probabl
the
toughest
deal
of
ani
kind
is
that
particular
deal
blitzer:
let
move
on
to
talk
about
north
korea
you
rais
it
governor
kasich
the
threat
pose
by
north
korea
to
the
unit
state
and
it
salli
the
command
of
american
forc
in
south
korea
said
that
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
Un
would
use
a
weapon
of
mass
destruct
if
he
thought
hi
regim
wa
be
threaten
you
have
said
the
unit
state
should
start
examin
a
strategi
of
regim
chang
in
north
korea
let
be
clear
are
you
talk
about
get
rid
of
kim
jong
un?
when
you
talk
about
regim
chang
wolf
it
mean
regim
chang
that
what
it
mean
even
though
there
so
much
chao
in
north
korea
right
now
there
a
lot
of
report
of
uncertainti
and
instabl
in
that
govern
but
look
here
what
I
think
we
ought
to
do
—
like
immedi
and
we
have
been
kick
the
can
down
the
road
on
thi
for
I
do
not
know
15
year
We
should
be
intercept
the
ship
that
are
leav
north
korea
so
they
are
not
sell
thi
materi
or
thi
technolog
or
give
it
to
someon
els
secondli
the
same
goe
with
the
aircraft
thirdli
we
need
to
slap
even
tougher
sanction
on
north
korea
becaus
we
realli
do
not
have
the
toughest
sanction
on
north
korea
We
ought
to
talk
about
arm
south
korea
with
ballist
missil
technolog
and
of
cours
also
japan
with
ballist
missil
technolog
becaus
we
are
now
start
to
take
a
firm
posit
We
have
the
attent
of
the
chines
the
chines
are
the
best
way
to
calm
that
regim
down
and
get
them
in
a
posit
of
where
they
back
off
but
when
I
say
regim
chang
I
do
not
have
to
talk
exactli
what
that
mean
look
I
have
been
involv
in
nation
secur
for
a
long
time
you
do
not
have
to
spell
everyth
out
but
what
i am
tell
you
is
you
look
for
ani
mean
you
can
to
be
abl
to
solv
that
problem
in
north
korea
and
in
the
meantim
put
the
pressur
on
the
chines
and
what
we
are
do
is
begin
to
work
against
them
they
are
the
key
to
be
abl
to
settl
thi
situat
blitzer:
I
just
want
to
be
precis
governor
kasich
thi
is
critic
import
there
are
a
million
north
korean
troop
north
of
the
dmz
i am
veri
well
awar
of
that
blitzer:
A
million
south
korean
troop
28,000
US
troop
along
the
dmz
right
in
between
would
you
risk
war
for
a
regim
change?
wolf
again
it
would
depend
exactli
what
you
know
what
wa
happen
what
the
situat
wa
but
if
there
wa
an
opportun
to
remov
the
leader
of
north
korea
and
creat
stability?
becaus
I
will
tell
you
you
keep
kick
the
can
down
the
road
we
are
go
to
face
thi
sooner
or
later
but
in
the
meantim
i am
also
awar
of
the
fact
that
there
10
million
peopl
live
in
seoul
So
you
do
not
just
run
around
make
charg
I
have
put
it
on
the
tabl
that
I
would
leav
to
see
regim
chang
in
north
korea
now
perhap
the
chines
can
actual
accomplish
that
with
thi
man
who
is
now
current
the
leader
but
the
fact
is
we
have
to
bring
everyth
to
bear
We
have
to
be
firm
and
we
have
got
to
unit
those
peopl
in
that
part
of
the
world
to
stand
firmli
against
north
korea
and
make
sure
we
have
the
ballistic[bel

missil
technolog
to
defend
ourselv
blitzer:
Mr
trump
one
thing
Id
like
to
add
to
what
the
governor
say
I
think
that
we
are
now
in
a
posit
—
are
$19
trillion
dollar
becaus
of
the
horribl
omnibu
budget
that
wa
approv
six

We

We
have
to
start
get
reimburs
for
take
care
of
the

servic
for
all
of
these
countri
[applause]
hey
wolf
wolf
blitzer:
Dr
carson
hey
wolf
let
me
just
say
thi
becaus
he
mention
thi
look
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
the
japanes
need
to
do
more
We
are
all
in
agreement
that
the
european
need
to
do
more
but
I
hate
to
just
tell
everybodi
we
are
the
leader
of
the
world
and
we
should
put
the
pressur
on
them
to
do
their
job
there
is
no
question
about
it
but
at
the
same
time
we
also
have
to
rebuild
the
militari
look
I
have
a
balanc
budget
plan
that
cut
tax
reform
regul
but
also
build
the
militari
put
a
$100
billion
dollar
more
in
defens
We
need
to
rebuild
our
defens
but
I
must
also
tell
you
a
long
time
reform
of
the
pentagon
we
must
reform
that
build
[bell
ringing]
We
can not
have
a

take
22
and
a
half
year
We
have
800,000
bureaucrat
work
for
dod
perform
bureaucrat
function
when
we
ought
to
be
put
blitzer:
thank
you
these
resourc
into
strengthen
the
militari
So
we
can
do
it
all
blitzer:
Dr
carson
how
would
you
deal
with
north
korea?
OK
well
first
of
all
peopl
say
that
I
whine
a
lot
becaus
I
do
not
get
time
i am
go
to
whine
becaus
I
did
not
get
ask
about
tax
I
did
not
get
ask
about
israel
hugh
you
said
you
are
go
to
be
fair
to
everybodi
you
did
not
ask
me
about
tax
I
had
someth
to
say
about
that
now
blitzer:
Go
ahead
thi
is
your
moment
[applause]
OK
We
have
a
system
of
taxat
in
thi
countri
that
is
horribl
wrong
you
know
I
never
had
an
audit
until
I
spoke
at
the
nation
prayer
breakfast
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
came
in
they
said
we
just
want
to
look
at
your
real
estat
deal
and
then
they
did
not
find
anyth
so
they
said
let u
look
at
the
whole
year
and
they
did
not
find
anyth
so
they
said
let u
look
at
the
next
year
and
the
next
year
they
did
not
find
anyth
and
they
will not
find
anyth
becaus
i am
a
veri
honest
person
but
he
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
ir
is
not
honest
and
we
need
to
get
rid
of
them
[applause]
and
as
far
as
israel
is
concern
you
know
when
I
wa
there
sever
month
ago
I
talk
to
a
lot
of
peopl
I
could
not
find
a
singl
one
who
did
not
think
that
we
had
turn
our
back
on
israel
you
know
they
are
a
strateg
partner
for
us
but
also
recogn
that
we
have
a
judeo
christian
foundat
and
the
last
thing
we
need
to
do
is
to
reject
israel
It
doe
not
mean
that
we
can not
be
fair
to
other
peopl
We
can
alway
be
fair
to
other
peopl
but
you
know
it
like
when
you
have
a
child
you
know
you
want
to
be
fair
to
all
the
children
around
but
you
have
a
special
attent
for
your
own
child
and
now
as
far
as
north
korea
is
concern
you
know
kim
jung
Un
is
an
unstabl
person
but
he
doe
understand
strength
and
I
think
we
have
to
present
strength
to
him
We
should
be
encourag
the
allianc
with
japan
and
south
korea
We
should
be
encourag
the
placement
of
the
thaad
the
termin
high-altitud
area
defens
that
seem
to
disturb
not
onli
the
north
korean
but
the
chines
as
well
and
we
also
need
to
have
a
much
more
robust
naval
presenc
in
that
area
and
I
think
we
need
to
be
develop
strateg
defens
initi
becaus
thi
man
is
go
to
have
long-rang
missil
he
is
go
to
have
nuclear
capabl
We
need
to
be
abl
to
defend
ourselv
and
lastli
we
should
make
sure
that
he
know
that
if
he
ever
shoot
a
missil
at
us
it
will
be
the
last
thing
he
ever
doe
[applause]
blitzer:
thank
you
thank
you
We
are
go
to
continu
with

Go
ahead

thank

wolf
Mr
trump
we
are
less
than
24
hour
away
from
a
ceasefir
in
syria
that
ha
been
broker
between
the
US
and
russia
Do
you
support
thi
ceasefire?
I
realli
do
not
becaus
it
not
work
and
the
countri
are
not
agre
to
it
and
the
rebel
are
not
agre
and
syria
is
not
agre
So
it
a
meaningless
ceasefir
I
love
the
idea
of
a
ceasefir
I
love
the
idea
of
—
with
a
total
cessat
but
it
not
work
as
you
know
veri
well
it
not
work
If
—
we
can
do
what
we
want
with
russia
but
nobodi
els
is
adher
to
it
So
I
certainli
support
it
I
would
certainli
love
it
but
all
parti
have
to
be
part
of
it
hewitt:
senat
cruz
your
opinion
on
the
ceasefir
well
look
We
are
certainli
hope
that
the
violenc
will
ceas
but
there
reason
to
be
highli
skeptic
russia
ha
enhanc
it
posit
becaus
of
obama
weak
in
the
middl
east
weak
in
syria
and
you
know
as
we
are
head
to
novemb
we
need
no
nomin
a
republican
candid
that
can
lay
out
a
clear
differ
with
both
barack
obama
and
hillari
clinton
on
foreign
polici
one
of
the
real
challeng
with
both
donald
and
senat
rubio
is
that
they
have
agre
over
and
over
again
with
both
hillari
clinton
and
barack
obama
So
for
exampl
in
libya
both

A

Mr

I
think
I
gave
them
both
check
to

exactli
honest
I
think
they
both
like
me
veri
much
but
the
fact
is
that
but
you
call
for
bush
to
be
impeach
well
I
think
bush
did
a
hell
of
a
bad
as
far
as
that
concern
you
know
it
and
so
do
I
but
you
gave
him
a
check
and
call
for
him
to
be
impeach
Be
honest
Be
honest
No
thi
wa
befor
the
check
came
earli
but
let
me
just
tell
you
syria
he
say
that
I
wa
in
favor
of
syria
He
said
I
wa
in
favor
of
libya?
I
never
discuss
that
subject
I
wa
in
favor
of
libya?
We
would
be
so
much
better
off
if
gadhafi
were
in
charg
right
now
If
these
politician
went
to
the
beach
and
did
not
do
a
thing
and
we
had
saddam
hussein
and
if
we
had
gadhafi
in
charg
instead
of
have
terror
all
over
the
place
wed
be
—
at
least
they
kill
terrorist
all
right?
and
i am
not
say
they
were
good
becaus
they
were
bad
they
were
realli
bad
but
we
do
not
know
what
we
are
get
you
look
at
libya
right
now
isi
as
we
speak
is
take
over
their

As
we
speak
it
a
total
mess
We
would
have
been
better
off
if
the

off
instead
of

I
argu
if

you
are
go
to
have

emerg
like

thi

[laughter

and
the
last
point
I
would
make
on

now
thi
is
import
becaus
we
are
ask
to

donald

he
say
these

here
whi

critic
donald

if

both
japan

south
korea
will
becom

weapon
power
they
can
do
that
veri
quickli
and
that
what
they
will
do
if
the
american
defens
agreement

away
which
is
whi
we
have
to
rebuild
the
militari
but
whi
we
can not

from

asia-pacif
defens
statu
hewitt:
Mr

I
would
not

I

I
assum
donald

apolog
where
he

that
he

exactli
that
with

I
will
say
john

ha
been
a
disast
for
decad
that
whi
I
vote
against

the
fact
that
donald

would
write
him

except
poor
foreign

call
upon
it
support
to

attack
on
our
neighbor
to
the
north
canada
As
a
matter
of
fact
US
offici
have
warn
that
it
is
the
canadian
border
which
is
the
most
signific
threat
you
have
said
that
you
will
not
build
a
wall
in
canada
when
it
come
to
nation
secur
and
the
threat
of
terror
whi
doe
mexico
need
a
wall
and
canada
doesnt?
Is
not
that
like
close
the
front
door
and
leav
the
back
door
open?
first
of
all
you
are
talk
about
a
border
that
mani
mani
time
longer
you
are
talk
about
a
massiv
border
We
have
far
less
problem
with
that
border
than
we
do
with
our
southern
border
and
tremend
amount
—
you
know
I
won
I
had
the
privileg
of
win
by
a
landslid
by
the
way
new
hampshir
you
go
to
new
hampshir
the
first
thing
they
talk
about
is
heroin
and
drug
pour
in
and
you
would
not
think
thi
beauti
place
—
it
beauti
with
the
tree
and
the
road
and
the
countrysid
their
biggest
problem
is
heroin
and
it
such
a
shame
to
see
it
they
are
pour
in
from
the
southern
border
so
i am
talk
about
great
secur
i am
talk
about
a
wall
that
can
absolut
be
built
and
I
will
build
it
on
time
on
budget
It
will
be
a
veri
high
wall
a
great
wall
it
go
to
be
built
it
go
to
be
built
it
go
to
be
paid
for
by
canada
by
the
way
—
mayb
I
will
get
canada
to
pay?
got
to
be
paid
for
by
mexico
the
problem
with
canada
you
are
talk
about
a
massiv
long
piec
you
are
talk
about
a
border
that
would
be
about
four
time
longer
It
would
be
veri
veri
hard
to
do
and
we
—
it
is
not
our
biggest
problem
I
do
not
care
what
anyon
say
It
is
not
our
big
problem
our
big
problem
is
not
onli
peopl
come
in
and
in
mani
case
the
wrong
peopl
it
the
tremend
amount
of
drug
that
are
come
in
[applause]
arrarás:
I
want
to
talk
to
you
senat
rubio
about
puerto
rico
As
you
know
puerto
rico
in
the
midst
of
financi
collaps
unabl
to
pay
it
debt
of
$72
billion
dollar
puerto
rico
is
ask
for
bankruptci
protect
which
would
give
puerto
rico
and
puerto
rican
which
are
US
citizen
you
know
that
—
the
tool
to
restructur
the
debt
that
is
the
same
debt
the
other
50
state
have
you
oppos
grant
puerto
rico
that
bankruptci
protect
you
say
that
it
is
onli
a
last
resort
measur
but
the
govern
of
puerto
rico
ha
said
that
bankruptci
is
it
last
resort
that
that
where
they
are
now
how
do
you
explain
thi
veri
strong
stanc
to
the
hundr
of
thousand
of
puerto
rican
that
vote
across
the
US

and
particularli
in
your
state
of
florida?
sure
becaus
bankruptci
doe
not
work
unless
you
chang
the
way
you
are
oper
or
you
are
go
to
be
bankrupt
again
and
the
problem
with
puerto
rico
is
it
economi
is
not
grow
It
ha
a
massiv
exodu
of
profession
and
other
that
are
leav
to
my
home
state
of
florida
and
all
over
the
countri
they
are
come
to
the
mainland
from
puerto
rico
becaus
the
economi
there
is
not
grow
it
too
expens
to
do
busi
there
the
tax
rate
is
too
high
the
govern
regul
are
too
extens
thi
year
alon
with
all
the
problem
they
are
have
they
bare
cut
their
budget
from
one
year
to
the
next
So
I
think
the
leadership
on
the
island
ha
to
show
their
willing
to
get
their
hous
in
order
and
put
in
place
measur
allow
the
economi
there
to
grow
again
If
the
economi
of
puerto
rico
doe
not
grow
they
will
never
gener
the
revenu
to
pay
thi
debt
or
the
billion
of
dollar
in
unfund
liabil
that
they
have
on
their
book
of
promis
they
have
made
to
futur
gener
to
make
payment
So
ye
if
they
do
all
of
those
thing
then
we
can
explor
the
use
of
bankruptci
protect
but
not
as
the
first
resort
which
is
what
they
are
ask
for
becaus
it
will
not
solv
the
problem
on
the
island
and
you
are
go
to
continu
to
see
hundr
of
thousand
of
peopl
leav
that
beauti
place
and
come
to
the
mainland
they
are
unit
state
citizen
they
are
obvious
entitl
to
do
so
and
we
welcom
them
but
we
would
also
prefer
to
see
a
puerto
rico
that
onc
again
is
grow
econom
and
is
robust
and
the
leader
in
charg
there
now
are
do
a
terribl
job
