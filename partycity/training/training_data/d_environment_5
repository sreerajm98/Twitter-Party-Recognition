No
well
I
do
not
think
I
have
chang
my
view
on
what
we
need
to
do
to
go
from
where
we
are
where
the
world
is
heavili
depend
on
coal
and
oil
but
princip
coal
to
where
we
need
to
be
which
is
clean
renew
energi
and
one
of
the
bridg
fuel
is
natur
ga
and
so
for
both
econom
and
environment
and
strateg
reason
it
wa
american
polici
to
tri
to
help
countri
get
out
from
under
the
constant
use
of
coal
build
coal
plant
all
the
time
also
to
get
out
from
under
especi
if
they
were
in
europ
the
pressur
from
russia
which
ha
been
incred
intens
So
we
did
say
natur
ga
is
a
bridg
We
want
to
cross
that
bridg
as
quickli
as
possibl
becaus
in
order
to
deal
with
climat
chang
we
have
got
to
move
as
rapidli
as
we
can
that
whi
I
have
set
big
goal
I
want
to
see
us
deploy
a
half
a
billion
more
solar
panel
by
the
end
of
my
first
term
and
enough
clean
energi
to
provid
electr
to
everi
home
in
america
within
10
year

So
I
have
big
bold
goal
but
I
know
in
order
to
get
from
where
we
are
where
the
world
is
still
burn
way
too
much
coal
where
the
world
is
still
too
intimid
by
countri
and
provid
like
russia
we
have
got
to
make
a
veri
firm
but
decis
move
in
the
direct
of
clean
energi
