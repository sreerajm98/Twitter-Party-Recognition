Do
the
founder
word
mean
what
they
say
or
is
it
a
live
document
to
be
appli
flexibl
accord
to
chang
circumstances?
In
thi
segment
secretari
clinton
you
go
first
you
have
two
minut
Mr
trump
thank
you
We
now
have
about
10
minut
for
an
open
discuss
I
want
to
focu
on
two
issu
that
in
fact
by
the
justic
that
you
name
could
end
up
chang
the
exist
law
of
the
land
first
is
one
that
you
mention
Mr

that
is
gun
secretari
clinton
you
said
last
year
let
me
quot
"the
suprem
court
is
wrong
on
the
second
amendment"
and
now
in
fact
in
the
2008
heller
case
the
court
rule
that
there
is
a
constitut
right
to
bear
arm
but
a
right
that
is
reason
limit
those
were
the

of

that
OK

not
OK

last
15
20

veri
much
involved—excus

My
turn
you
were
veri
much
involv
in
everi
aspect
of
thi
countri
veri
much
and
you
do
have
experi
I
say
the
one
thing
you
have
over
me
is
experi
but
it
bad
experi
becaus
what
you
have
done
ha
turn
out
badli
for
30
year
you
have
been
in
a
posit
to
help
and
if
you
say
that
I
use
steel
or
I
use
someth
els
i—mak
it
imposs
for
me
to
do
that
I
would
not
mind
the
problem
is
you
talk
but
you
do
not
get
anyth
done
hillari
you
do
not
just
like
when
you
ran
the
state
depart
$6
billion
wa
miss
how
do
you
miss
$6
billion?
you
ran
the
state
depart
$6
billion
wa
either
stolen
they
do
not
know
it
gone
$6
billion
If
you
becom
presid
thi
countri
is
go
to
be
in
some
mess
believ
me
give
me
a
break
well
first
of
all
those
stori
have
been
larg
debunk
those
people—i
do
not
know
those
peopl
I
have
a
feel
how
they
came
I
believ
it
wa
her
campaign
that
did
it
just
like
if
you
look
at
what
came
out
today
on
the
clip
where
I
wa
wonder
what
happen
with
my
ralli
in
chicago
and
other
ralli
where
we
had
such
violence?
she
the
one
and
obama
that
caus
the
violenc
they
hire
people—they
paid
them
$1500
and
they
are
on
tape
say
be
violent
caus
fight
do
bad
thing
I
would
say
the
onli
way—becaus
those
stori
are
all
total
fals
I
have
to
say
that
and
I
did
not
even
apolog
to
my
wife
who
sit
right
here
becaus
I
did
not
do
anyth
I
did
not
know
ani
of
these—i
did
not
see
these
women
these
women—th
woman
on
the
plane
the—i
think
they
want
either
fame
or
her
campaign
did
it
and
I
think
it
her
campaign
becaus
what
I
saw
what
they
did
which
is
a
crimin
act
by
the
way
where
they
are
tell
peopl
to
go
out
and
start
fist-fight
and
start
violenc
and
I
will
tell
you
what
in
particular
in
chicago
peopl
were
hurt
and
peopl
could
have
been
kill
in
that
riot
and
that
wa
now
all
on
tape
start
by
her
I
believ
chri
that
she
got
these
peopl
to
step
forward
If
it
wa
not
they
get
their
10
minut
of
fame
but
they
were
all
totally—it
wa
all
fiction
It
wa
lie
and
it
wa
fiction

He

I
agre
with

a
big
mistak
secretari

last
debat
and
again
today—that
you
would
impos
a
no-fli
zone
to
tri
to
protect
the
peopl
of
aleppo
and
to
stop
the
kill
there
presid
obama

refus
to
do
that
becaus
he
fear
it
go
to
draw

and
gener
joseph

of
the
joint
chief
of

a
no-fli
zone
chanc
are
you

is—thi
is
the
final

put
a
clock
up
a
minut
as
the
final
question
in
