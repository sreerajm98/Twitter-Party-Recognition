Id
like
to
follow
up
on
a
comment
that
secretari
clinton
said
senat
presid
obama
ha
not
call
for
abolish
the
death
penalti
presid
obama
is
for
the
big
asian
trade
deal
known
as
tpp
and
just
yesterday
you
said
you
can not
be
both
a
moder
or
a
progress
but
you
can not
be
both
Is
presid
obama
in
your
judgment
base
on
these
polici
posit
a
progressive?
let
me
just
pick
up
on
thi
point
thi
whole
discuss
began
becaus
I
comment
not
make
overal
evalu
about
the
secretari
she
wa
in
ohio
I
think
in
septemb
or
novemb
and
she
got
up
and
said
someth
like
I
have
been—im
paraphras
I
have
been
critic
becaus
peopl
think
i am
a
moder
well
I
am
a
moder
that
where
thi
came
from
It
wa
not
me
paraphras
her
It
is
what
she
said
and
all
that
I
said
wa
there
noth
wrong
with
be
a
moder
but
you
can not
be
a
moder
you
can not
a
progress
In
term
of
presid
obama
I
think
if
we
rememb
where
thi
countri
wa
seven
year
ago
800,000
job
be
lost
everi
month
$14
trillion
dollar
deficit
the
world
financi
system
on
the
verg
of
collaps
I
think
that
presid
obama
vice
presid
biden
and
the
democrat
leadership
in
the
hous
and
the
senat
have
done
a
fantast
job
We
are
in
much
better
shape
than
we
were
seven
year
ago
although
my
republican
colleagu
seem
to
have
forgotten
where
we
were
seven
year
ago
that
the
fact
but
we
still
have
a
veri
long
way
to
go
Do
I
think
presid
obama
is
a
progressive?
ye
I
do
I
disagre
with
him
on
a
number
of
issu
includ
the
trade
agreement
but
ye
I
think
he
ha
done
an
excel
job
let
me—let—w
are
gonna—w
are
staying—w
are
stay
basic
on
thi
topic
obvious
you
have
been
emphas
thi
differ
on
the
iraq
war
but
one
place
where
you
do
agre
and
one
place
where
you
vote
to
author
the
use
of
forc
wa
in
favor
of
the
war
in
afghanistan
right
now
it
is
possibl
presid
obama
is
go
to
be
leav
the
next
presid
perhap
presid
sander
at
least
10,000
troop
in
afghanistan
how
long
will
those
troop
be
in
afghanistan
under
presid
sanders?
