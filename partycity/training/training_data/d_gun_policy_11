I
think
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
move
as
aggress
as
we
can
to
normal
relat
with
iran
understand
that
iran
behavior
in
so
mani
way
is
someth
that
we
disagre
with;
their
support
terror
the
anti-american
rhetor
that
we
are
hear
from
of
their
leadership
is
someth
that
is
not
accept
On
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
we
have
manag
to
reach
an
agreement
someth
that
I
have
veri
strongli
support
that
prevent
iran
from
get
a
nuclear
weapon
and
we
did
that
without
go
to
war
and
that
I
believ
we
are
see
a
fall
in
our
relationship
with
iran
is
a
veri
posit
step
So
if
your
question
is
do
I
want
to
see
that
relationship
becom
more
posit
in
the
future?
ye
can
I
tell
that
we
should
open
an
embassi
in
tehran
tomorrow?
No
I
do
not
think
we
should
but
I
think
the
goal
ha
go
to
be
as
we
have
done
with
cuba
to
move
in
warm
relat
with
a
veri
power
and
import
countri
in
thi
world
mitchell:

respons

clinton?
look
I
think
that
the
presid
decis
to
go
after
the
chemic
weapon
onc
there
wa
a
potenti
opportun
to
build
on
when
the
russian
open
that
door
result
in
a
veri
posit
outcom
We
were
abl
to
get
the
chemic
weapon
out
I
know
from
my
own
experi
as
secretari
of
state
that
we
were
deepli
worri
about
assad
forc
use
chemic
weapon
becaus
it
would
have
had
not
onli
a
horrif
affect
on
peopl
in
syria
but
it
could
veri
well
have
affect
the
surround
state
jordan
israel
lebanon
turkey
So
get
those
chemic
weapon
out
wa
a
big
deal
but
mitchell:
but
should
he
â€”
should
he
have
stuck
