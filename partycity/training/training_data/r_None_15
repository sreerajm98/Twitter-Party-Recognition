so
I

[laughter

senat
cruz
you
talk
about
the
first
gulf
war
as
be
a
kind
of
model
for
your
focus
and
determin
effort
to
go
after
isi
but
there
were
700,000
ground
troop
as
a
part
of
that
and
you
do
not
have
a
ground
compon
to
your
plan
why?
veri
quickli
30-second
follow-up
you
have
said
that
essenti
the
kurd
would
be
the
american
ground
forc
in
there
the
critic
that
expert
have
on
that
is
that
the
kurd
onli
can
work
within
their
territori
If
they
take
larger
amount
of

you
have

well
let
me
say
it
at
the
outset
that
everyon
here
understand
—
everyon
understand
that
how
—
that
the
middl
class
ha
been
left
behind
in
the
last
seven
year
of
the
obama
economi
and
we
have
got
to
bring
job
back
We
have
got
to
get
peopl
back
to
work
We
have
got
to
get
wage
go
up
again
We
have
got
to
get
peopl
move
from
part-tim
work
to
full-tim
work
We
all
agre
on
that
but
it
not
go
to
be
solv
with
magic
pixi
dust
it
just
go
to
be
solv
by
declar
into
the

"let
there
be
jobs"
We
actual
have
to
understand
the
principl
that
made
america
great
in
the
first
place
now
where
do
you
get
econom
growth?
If
you
look
at

and

over
our

histori
everi

we
lessen
the
burden
of
washington
on

the

—
conserv
have
sort
of
thi
idea
conceptu
for
a
long
time
but
especi
on
thi
consumpt

system
In

where
it

it
ha
becom
an

of

and
that
whi
conserv
have
long
resist
it
whi
and
what
would
you
do
as

to
make
sure
that
doe
not
happen?
now
major
the
busi
flat
tax
that
is
in
my
tax
plan
is
not
a

A
vat
in
europ
is
a
sale
tax
the
busi
flat
tax
is
not
a
sale
tax
it
is
a
tax
of
16
percent
oppos
fairli
and
evenli
across
the
board
on
all
busi
one
of
the
thing
that
critic
is
we
are
do
that
in
conjunct
with
abolish
the
corpor
incom
tax
with
abolish
the
obamacar
tax
with
abolish
the
payrol
tax
which
are
the
biggest
tax
paid
by
most
work
american
and
with
abolish
the
death
tax
which
is
cruel
and
unfair
and
you
ask
about
econom
growth
—
the
nonpartisan
tax
foundat
estim
a
simpl
flat
tax
that
would
produc
49
million
new
job
it
would
increas
capit
invest
by
44
percent
and
would
lift
everyon
incom
by
doubl
digit
that
how
you
turn
the
countri
around
not
just
hope
and
pray
for
it
but
implement
polici
that
work
strassel:
OK
I
have
a
question
a
relat
tax
question
senat
rubio
you
have
the
highest
tax
rate
of
anyon
up
on
the
stage
in
term
of
the
top
tax
rate
35
percent
some
economist
say
"it
would
limit
it
potenti
to
boost
econom
growth"
you
do
that
so
that
you
will
have
more
revenu
to
pay
for
a
tripl
of
the
child
tax
credit
normal
it
liber
who
like
to
use
the
tax
code
to
insert
social
polici
whi
should
conserv
who
want
to
tax
adopt
the
other
side
approach?
well
becaus
i am
influenc
social
polici
—
thi
is
their
money
thi
is
the
money
of
parent
you
do
not
earn
the
tax
credit
unless
you
are
work
that
your
money
it
doe
not
belong
to
govern
here
what
I
do
not
understand
If
a
busi
take
their
money
and
they
invest
in
the
piec
of
the
equip
they
get
to
write
off
their
tax
but
if
a
parent
take
money
that
they
have
earn
to
work
and
invest
in
their
children
they
dont?
thi
make
no
sens
parent
is
the
most
import
job
ani
of
us
will
ever
have
famili
format
is
the
most
import
thing
in
societi
So
what
my
tax
plan
doe
is
it
doe
creat
especi
for
work
famili
an
addit
child
tax
credit
So
that
parent
who
are
work
get
to
keep
more
of
their
own
money
not
the
govern
money
to
invest
in
their
children
to
go
to
school
to
go
to
a
privat
school
to
buy
a
new
backpack
let
me
tell
you
if
you
are
a
parent
that
struggl
then
you
know
that
$50
a
month
is
the
differ
between
a
new
pair
of
shoe
thi
month
or
not
get
a
new
pair
of
shoe
for
your
kid
i am
go
to
have
a
tax
plan
that
is
pro-famili
becaus
the
famili
is
the
most

institut
in

you
cannot
have
a
strong

without

governor

thi
on
is
on
size
of
govern
In
2013
you
push
through
a
medicaid
reform
in
your
state
over
the
reject
of
mani
of
the
republican
in
your

total
enrol
and
overal
cost
of
program
have
gone
well
beyond
what
anyon
had
expect
includ
yourself
how
can
you
argu
that
thi
overal
growth
fit
in
with
conserv
ambit
to
significantli
cut
back
on
the
size
of
feder
welfar
programs?
yeah
well
first
of
all
those
number
incorrect
We
are
—
our
medicaid
program
are
come
in
below
cost
estim
and
our
medicaid
program
in
the
second
year
grew
at
25
percent
and
kimberley
let
me
tell
you
when
we
expand
medicaid
and
we
treat
the
mental
ill
then
they
do
not
live
under
a
bridg
or
live
in
a
prison
where
they
cost
$22500
a
year
when
we
take
the
drug
addict
and
we
treat
them
in
the
prison
we
stop
the
revolv
door
of
peopl
in
and
out
of
prison
and
we
save
$22500
a
year
guess
what
else?
they
get
their
live
back
and
the
work
poor
they
are
now
get
health
care
and
you
know
that
about
a
third

We

—
line
you
would
draw
legisl
as
a
presid
on
immigr
reform
defin
amnesti
well
first
of
all
I
think
amnesti
is
the
forgiv
of
a
wrongdo
without
consequ
and
that
—
I
have
never
support
that
I
do
not
support
that
I
think
there
ha
to
be
consequ
for
violat
our
immigr
law
what
I
think
is
clear
about
thi
issu
to
begin
with
is
we
are
not
go
to
be
abl
to
make
progress
on
illeg
immigr
until
first
illeg
immigr
is
brought
under
control
you
go
back
to
1986
when
they
legal
three
million
peopl
and
they
promis
to
secur
the
border
It
did
not
happen
and
as
a
result
peopl
have
lost
trust
in
the
feder
govern
It
is
now
clear
that
the
onli
way
to
make
progress
on
immigr
is
not
just
to
pass
a
law
that
enforc
the
law
but
actual
prove
to
peopl
that
it
work
they
want
to
see
the
wall
built
they
want
to
see
the
addit

agent
they
want

they
want
to
see
an

in

illeg
are
enter
legal
and
overstay

and
onli
after
all
of
that
is
in
place
then
we
will
see
what
the
american
peopl
are
will
to
support
on
thi

I

the

will
be

who

all
they

you
can not

bush:
great
question
I
feel
like
I
have
to
get
into
my
inner
chri
christi
and
point
out
that
the
reason
whi
I
should
be
presid
is
listen
to
two
senat
talk
about
arcan
amend
to
bill
that
did
not
pass
[applause]
thi
is
—
thi
is
the
problem
We
need
a
leader
to
fix
thi
problem
and
I
have
a
detail
plan
to
do
just
that
includ
control
the
border
deal
with
the
visa
over-stay
make
sure
that
we
have
a
path
to
legal
statu
not
to
citizenship
for
those
that
come
out
from
the
shadow
and
pay
a
fine
learn
english
do
not
commit
crime
work
and
pay
tax
that
is
the
better
approach
garrett:
fundament
do
you
believ
thi
rhetor
is
insuffici
compassion
to
thi
issue?
bush:
the
great
major
of
peopl
that
come

come
becaus
they
have
no
other
choic
they
want
to
come
to
provid
for
their
famili
that
doe
not
mean
it
right
that
doe
not
mean
it
right
We
should
pick
who
come
to
our
countri
We
should
control
our
border
come
here
legal
should
be
a
lot
easier
than
come
here
illeg
but
the
motiv
they
are
not
all
rapist
as
you-know-who
said
they
are
not
that
these
are
peopl
that
are
come
to
provid
for
their

and
we
should
show
a
littl
more
respect
for
the
fact
that
they

It
doe

how
you
have
been
in
your

a
warrior
for
the

I
think
it
is
a
veri
import
question
becaus
the
peopl
who
have
been

the
most
in

economi
had

We
have

1977
and
the
sad
realiti
is
big

what
we
need

is
bring

small

two-third
of

If
we
want
to
lift
peopl
out

—
you

I
think
of
these
issu
from
the
perspect
of
my

My
dad
fled
cuba
in
1957
He
wa
just
18
He
could
not

He
had

He
had
$100
in

underwear
and
he
wash
dish
make
50
cent
an

and
paid
hi
way
through
school
today
my
dad
is
a
pastor
He
travel
the
countri
preach
the
gospel
now
I
think
about
all
of
these
issu
how
would
it
impact
my
dad
when
he
wa
wash
dishes?
If
we
had
obamacar
in
place
right
now
the
odd
are
veri
high
my
father
would
have
been
laid
off
becaus
it
teenag
kid
like
my

who
have
gotten
laid
off
If

did

the
odd
are
high
he
would
have
had

forcibl
reduc
to
28
29
hour
a

We
need
to
lift
the
burden
on
small

so
you
have
job
and
we
need
welfar

that
get
